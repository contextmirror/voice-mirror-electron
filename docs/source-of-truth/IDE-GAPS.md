> **Major update since 2026-03-11:** §17 "Universal App Vision" has **shipped** as
> the see-and-drive **App Preview / sandbox** subsystem (WGC window capture +
> MJPEG streaming + CDP/UIA driving + event-driven window-follow + `sandbox_*`
> MCP tools). It is **Windows-only** for v1. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` and
> `docs/internal/LAUNCH-READINESS.md`.

## Current Status: "Capable Editor with AI Terminal"

Someone **can** code in Lens today. The core loop works:

1. Open project in file tree
2. Open files in tabs (CodeMirror 6 editor)
3. Edit with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, LSP diagnostics
4. Save with Ctrl+S
5. Open a shell tab, run `npm test` or `cargo build`
6. See git changes, open diffs
7. AI terminal (Claude Code) is always available for voice-driven development
8. Project output channels capture dev server logs + browser console for AI debugging

What's missing is everything that makes a "real IDE" feel seamless — the gaps below.

## LSP Feature Comparison

> Full LSP gap analysis lives in [`docs/source-of-truth/LSP-GAP.md`](LSP-GAP.md) — configuration alignment, 37-feature matrix, behavior differences, and implementation priorities.

**Current:** 37/37 features. All 5 waves + frontend CodeMirror wiring complete — core editing, navigation (Tier 1 + 2), inline assistance, formatting/editing, visual enhancements, and infrastructure all implemented.

| Category | VS Code | Voice Mirror | Coverage |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Core (5) | 5/5 | 5/5 | 100% |
| Navigation Tier 1 (5) | 5/5 | 5/5 | 100% |
| Navigation Tier 2 (6) | 6/6 | 6/6 | 100% |
| Inline Assistance (3) | 3/3 | 3/3 | 100% |
| Formatting & Editing (5) | 5/5 | 5/5 | 100% |
| Visual (3) | 3/3 | 3/3 | 100% |
| Infrastructure (10) | 10/10 | 10/10 | 100% |

---

## Gap Details

### 1. Global Text Search (Ctrl+Shift+F) — DONE ✓

**Status:** Fully implemented. Ctrl+Shift+F opens Search tab in FileTree panel.

**Backend:** `search_content` command in `files/search.rs` — uses `ignore::WalkBuilder` (gitignore-aware) + `regex::Regex` for content search. Supports case sensitivity, regex mode, whole-word matching, include/exclude glob filters. Caps at 200 files / 5000 matches.

**Frontend:** `SearchPanel.svelte` in FileTree's 4th tab — search input, Aa/regex/word toggles, include/exclude filters, results grouped by file with icons, match highlighting via `<mark>`, 300ms debounce. Click result navigates to file + line.

**Store:** `search.svelte.js` — reactive state with `searchId` counter to discard stale async responses.

**Keybinding:** Ctrl+Shift+F (works from any context including inputs/editors).

---

### 2. Find & Replace (In-File) — DONE ✓

**Status:** Already works. `basicSetup` from the `codemirror` package bundles `@codemirror/search` with `searchKeymap` and `highlightSelectionMatches`. The editor theme already styles `.cm-panels`, `.cm-searchMatch`, and `.cm-searchMatch-selected`.

**Keybindings:** Ctrl+F (find), Ctrl+H (find & replace), F3/Shift+F3 (next/prev), Alt+Enter (select all matches). Supports match case, regex, and whole-word toggles.

---

### 3. Split Editor — FEATURE COMPETE ✓

**Status:** Feature compete with VS Code for real-world usage. Users can split in any direction, drag files from the tree with smart snap zones, drag between seams for full-width splits, resize panels, navigate directionally, maximize groups, and reset sizes. The remaining gaps are power-user features that most developers never use.

#### What's Done

- **Basic splitting** — Right, down, left, up via keyboard (Ctrl+\\), context menu, and drag-to-split
- **Arbitrary nesting** — Recursive binary tree (3+ groups, unlimited depth)
- **Drag tab between groups** — Cross-group tab moves with auto-close on empty groups
- **Drag tab to split zones** — Custom MIME type, DropZoneOverlay detects tab drags, 5-zone split on drop (Wave 2)
- **Drag file from tree to split** — 5 zones (center/L/R/T/B) with `DropZoneOverlay.svelte`, 22% edge threshold
- **Full-width seam splits** — Drag to the divider between two panes for ancestor-level splits spanning all columns/rows
- **Panel resizing** — SplitPanel with drag ratio (clamped 10%-90%)
- **Focus group 1/2** — Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2
- **Focus directional** — Ctrl+K Ctrl+Arrow (left/right/up/down) via tree-walking neighbor detection
- **Even sizes** — Ctrl+K Ctrl+= resets all branch ratios to 0.5
- **Maximize toggle** — Ctrl+K Ctrl+M shows only focused group, auto-restores on split/close
- **Context menu** — Split Right, Split Down, Open to the Side, Close Split, Close Others, Close to Right
- **Close group** — Auto-collapses parent branch, shifts focus to sibling
- **Preview vs pinned tabs** — Single-click = preview (auto-replaced), double-click = pinned
- **Auto-cleanup** — Closing last tab in a group closes the group

#### What's Missing

**High value (small scope):**
1. **Move editor by keyboard** — Ctrl+K Ctrl+Shift+Arrow to move a tab to the neighboring group without dragging
2. **Persist layout** — Save grid tree + ratios to config, restore on next session

**Nice to have:**
3. **Layout presets** — "2 columns", "2x2 grid", "3 columns" via command palette
4. **Join groups** — Merge two groups' tabs into one
5. **Ctrl+3...8** — Focus more than 2 groups by number
6. **Copy editor** — Open same file in two groups (currently only move)

**Skip:**
- Lock group — niche feature, rarely used
- Split in group — VS Code-only feature, minimal adoption
- Drag to new window — Voice Mirror is single-window by design
- Layout serialization API — no extension system needs it
- Cycle focus / focus without wrapping — directional focus covers the use case
- Move/copy entire group — drag covers this
- Expand active group — maximize covers this

---

### 4. Multi-Cursor Editing — DONE ✓

**Status:** Fully working. `basicSetup` bundles `searchKeymap` which includes `selectNextOccurrence` and `selectSelectionMatches`. Custom vertical cursor keybindings added in `editor-extensions.js`.

**Keybindings:**
- **Ctrl+D** → select next occurrence (via `searchKeymap`)
- **Ctrl+Shift+L** → select all occurrences (via `searchKeymap`)
- **Ctrl+Alt+Up** → add cursor on line above (custom)
- **Ctrl+Alt+Down** → add cursor on line below (custom)
- **Alt+Click** → add cursor at click position (CodeMirror default)
- **Escape** → collapse to single cursor

---

### 5. Git Integration — DONE ✓ (core workflow complete)

**Status:** Full staging/commit/push/pull cycle implemented with branch management and remote sync.

**Backend:** 15 Rust commands — `get_git_changes`, `get_file_git_content`, `git_stage`, `git_unstage`, `git_stage_all`, `git_unstage_all`, `git_commit`, `git_discard`, `git_push`, `git_ahead_behind`, `git_fetch`, `git_pull`, `git_force_push`, `git_list_branches`, `git_checkout_branch`.

**Frontend:**
- `GitCommitPanel.svelte` — commit textarea, Commit / Commit & Push buttons, Ctrl+Enter shortcut
- Branch picker dropdown — local + remote branches, filterable, keyboard navigable, checkout with confirmation
- Dynamic sync button — "Pull N" / "Push N" / "Fetch" / "Publish" based on `git_ahead_behind` counts
- Zed-style fetch dropdown — Fetch, Pull, Pull (Rebase), Push, Force Push (with confirmation)
- `GitChangesPanel.svelte` — staged/unstaged groups, per-file stage/unstage/discard, status badges (A/M/D/R) with tooltips

**Remaining gaps:** See §11 (Source Control), §12 (Diff Viewer), §13 (File Tree) for detailed gap analysis.

---

### ~~6. Command Palette (Full Commands) — DONE~~ ✓

**What real IDEs have:** Ctrl+Shift+P opens a command palette that lists **every available command** — hundreds of them. Theme switching, format document, toggle word wrap, restart LSP, run test, etc. Extensions register their own commands too.

**What we have now:**
- Central command registry (`src/lib/commands.svelte.js`) with 48 commands across 10 categories (View, Editor, File, Search, LSP, Git, Terminal, Chat, Voice, System)
- Prefix-based modes matching VS Code: `>` commands, `:` go-to-line, `@` go-to-symbol, no prefix = file search
- Opening shortcuts: Ctrl+P (files), Ctrl+Shift+P/F1 (commands), Ctrl+G (go-to-line), Ctrl+Shift+O (go-to-symbol)
- MRU (Most Recently Used) history with localStorage persistence — recently used commands appear first
- Category grouping with section headers, keybinding badges (`<kbd>`), category tags
- Fuzzy search via `fuzzysort` for files, commands, and symbols
- Symbol mode uses LSP `documentSymbols` with kind badges (function, class, variable, etc.)
- Go-to-line dispatches `lens-goto-position` to the focused editor group
- Registry API: `register()`, `registerMany()`, `unregister()`, `execute()`, `search()`, `getAll()`
- Component-level commands (save, format) via `CustomEvent` dispatch pattern

---

### 7. Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) — LOW PRIORITY

**What real IDEs have:** Set breakpoints by clicking the gutter. Press F5 to start debugging. Step through code line by line. Inspect variables, call stack, watch expressions. Conditional breakpoints.

**What we have:** Nothing. Zero debug infrastructure.

**Why it matters (less than you'd think):** With AI-driven development, `console.log` debugging + asking Claude "why does this fail?" is often faster than traditional debugging. Most Voice Mirror users will lean on the AI terminal for debugging rather than a visual debugger.

**What's needed (if ever):**
- DAP client in Rust (like the LSP client)
- Breakpoint UI in the editor gutter
- Debug panel (variables, call stack, watch)
- Launch configuration system
- Language-specific debug adapters (Node.js, Python, LLDB for Rust)

**Estimated scope:** Massive — this is one of the most complex IDE features. VS Code's debugger is thousands of files. Zed's is still limited.

**Recommendation:** Defer indefinitely. Let the AI terminal handle debugging via voice commands. Revisit if users specifically request it.

---

### 8. Extensions / Plugins — NOT PLANNED

**What real IDEs have:** VS Code has 50,000+ extensions. Zed has a growing extension system. Cursor inherited VS Code's extensions. Extensions add languages, themes, debuggers, linters, formatters, and entirely new features.

**What we have:** Nothing. All features are built-in.

**Why it matters (debatable):** Extensions are what made VS Code dominant. But they also bring:
- Performance overhead
- Security risks (supply chain)
- Maintenance burden (API stability promises)
- Complexity for users (which extension? conflicts?)

**Recommendation:** Don't build a VS Code-style extension system. Instead, lean into:
- **MCP servers** as the "extension" mechanism — users add capabilities via MCP
- **Built-in language support** via LSP (already working)
- **Theme customization** (already working)
- **Tool profiles** for different workflows (already working)

Voice Mirror's extension story is: "Add an MCP server" — not "install a VS Code extension."

---

### 9. Terminal — SEE §14 FOR FULL ANALYSIS

**Status:** Rich terminal system with split panes, sidebar tree, tab coloring/icons, dev-server integration, AI terminal + user shells (both xterm.js+WebGL), shell profiles, and drag-to-reorder. See §14 below for the gap summary. (The standalone `docs/archive/TERMINAL-GAP-ANALYSIS.md` referenced here is no longer present.)

---

### 10. Code Minimap — DONE ✓

**Status:** Fully implemented. The regular file editor uses `@replit/codemirror-minimap` (^0.5.2) applied unconditionally in `editor-extensions.js`. The diff viewer also has its own `DiffMinimap.svelte` showing change locations with proportional chunk markers.

2. ~~Editor gutter change indicators (green/blue/red bars) — instant visual feedback while editing~~ ✓ Done

---

### 12. Diff Viewer

> Compared against VS Code's diff editor and Zed's buffer diff.

#### What We Have

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Unified diff view | ✅ | CodeMirror `unifiedMergeView` |
| Side-by-side (split) diff | ✅ | CodeMirror `MergeView`, toggle on toolbar |

| 1 | **Tab close button** | Hover-reveal X button, middle-click, last-group safety, dev-server confirmation | 30 source-inspection |
| 2 | **Grid splits (H + V)** | Recursive split tree (`split-tree.js`), Split Right / Split Down, max depth 3 (~8 panes) | 23 unit + 33 source-inspection |
| 3 | **Terminal persistence** | Layout saved to config (debounced 500ms), fresh PTYs on restore, profile fallback | 11 unit + source-inspection in split tests |
| 4 | **Find in terminal** | `terminal-search.js` + `TerminalSearch.svelte`, Ctrl+F, regex, case toggle, match navigation | 19 unit + 64 source-inspection |
| 5 | **Clickable links** | Ctrl+click overlay (`terminal-link-overlay.js`), opens URLs via shell + files in editor with line:col | 43 source-inspection |

#### Remaining Terminal Gaps

The top 5 high-priority terminal gaps are now closed. Remaining gaps are medium/low priority (shell integration, broadcast input, font zoom, etc.).

---

### 15. Editor (CodeMirror)

> Non-LSP editor features compared against VS Code and Zed.

#### What We Have

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Syntax highlighting (8 languages) | ✅ |
| Autocomplete (activateOnTyping) | ✅ |
| Find & replace (Ctrl+F, Ctrl+H) | ✅ |
| Multi-cursor (Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Shift+L, Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down) | ✅ |
| Word wrap toggle | ❌ (only in DiffViewer + OutputPanel, not in file editor) |
| Go-to-line (Ctrl+G) | ✅ |
| Bracket matching | ✅ |
| Auto-indent | ✅ |
| Dirty tracking + conflict detection | ✅ |
| Read-only mode for external files | ✅ |
| Markdown preview/edit toggle | ✅ |
| Custom theme (synced with app theme) | ✅ |
| Format document (Shift+Alt+F) | ✅ |
| Format on save | ✅ |
| Code actions lightbulb gutter (💡 + Ctrl+.) | ✅ |
| Font zoom (Ctrl+=/−/0) | ✅ |
| Inline gutter change indicators (green/blue/red + peek + revert) | ✅ |
| Back/forward navigation (Alt+Left/Right) | ✅ |
| Ctrl+hover definition underline | ✅ |
| Code minimap (@replit/codemirror-minimap) | ✅ |

#### Gaps

| Feature | VS Code | Zed | Voice Mirror | Priority |
|---------|---------|-----|-------------|----------|
| **Inline gutter change indicators** | ✅ Green/blue/red bars (add/modify/delete) | ✅ | ✅ Green/blue/red bars + peek + revert | Done ✓ |
| **Word wrap toggle** | ✅ Toggle line wrapping | ✅ | ❌ (only in DiffViewer + OutputPanel) | Small |
| **Indent guides** | ✅ Colored lines showing nesting depth | ✅ | ✅ `@replit/codemirror-indentation-markers` + status bar toggle | Done ✓ |
| **Bracket pair colorization** | ✅ Rainbow brackets | ✅ | ❌ | Low |
| **Sticky scroll** | ✅ Pin scope headers (function/class) at top | ✅ | ❌ | Low |
| **Code folding UI** | ✅ Gutter fold markers, fold/unfold all | ✅ | ⚠️ CM has folding but no visible gutter markers | Low |
| **Emmet abbreviation expansion** | ✅ HTML/CSS shorthand | ❌ | ❌ | Low |
| **Snippet system** | ✅ User-defined snippets | ✅ | ❌ | Low |
| **Image preview in editor** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Very low |

**Assessment:** Core editing is feature-complete. Indent guides are now implemented via `@replit/codemirror-indentation-markers` with active block highlighting and a toggle in the status bar indentation dropdown. The file editor is missing a word wrap toggle (exists in DiffViewer + OutputPanel but not the main editor). The next biggest editor gaps are word wrap toggle, bracket pair colorization, and sticky scroll.

## Voice Mirror's Unique Angle

The gap list above looks daunting, but Voice Mirror doesn't need to close every gap to be compelling. The features no other IDE has:

1. **Voice as first-class input** — "rename this function to handleSubmit" works via AI + LSP rename
2. **Persistent AI memory** — Claude remembers your codebase across sessions
3. **Always-on-top overlay** — code while referencing other apps
4. **MCP tool ecosystem** — browser control, n8n workflows, memory system
5. **AI-native terminal** — Claude Code is embedded, not a bolt-on extension

The strategy: close the top gaps so Lens is **comfortable enough** for real coding, then double down on the voice+AI features no one else has.

6. **Universal app vision** ✓ shipped (Windows) — see *and drive* any running window (games, CAD, spreadsheets) via the App Preview / sandbox (WGC capture + CDP/UIA). No other tool does this.

**Done:** find/replace ✓, multi-cursor ✓, global search ✓, git stage+commit+push ✓, branch management ✓, dynamic sync ✓, document formatting ✓, signature help ✓, split editor ✓, command palette ✓, file tree git decorations ✓, LSP diagnostics in tree ✓, code minimap ✓, terminal tab close ✓, terminal grid splits (H+V) ✓, terminal find (Ctrl+F) ✓, terminal clickable links (Ctrl+click) ✓, terminal persistence ✓, inline gutter change indicators ✓, closed tab history + Ctrl+Shift+T ✓, mouse wheel scroll on tab bar ✓, back/forward navigation (Alt+Left/Right) ✓, Ctrl+hover definition underline ✓, Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown tab cycling ✓, tab drag to split zones ✓, Problems panel (Ctrl+Shift+M) ✓, code actions lightbulb gutter ✓, font zoom (Ctrl+=/−/0) ✓, LSP server management Phase 1 ✓, LSP crash recovery + health monitoring + idle shutdown (Phase 2) ✓, LSP project scanning + multi-server routing + native binary support (Phase 3) ✓, project output channels (build logs + browser console → MCP) ✓, keyboard tree navigation (arrow keys) ✓, drag-to-move files in tree ✓.

**Next wave:** hunk-level staging (stage individual diff chunks from the gutter). This is the remaining high-impact gap that separates "usable" from "daily driver." The file tree is now feature-compete for navigation (keyboard + drag-to-move). The terminal is feature-compete with VS Code for core workflows. LSP is now feature-compete across the full 37-feature matrix (inlay hints, workspace symbols, semantic tokens, code lens, document colors, etc. all shipped) — the only remaining LSP work is surfacing a few backend-only features (workspace symbols, call/type hierarchy) in dedicated UI panels. See [`LSP-GAP.md`](LSP-GAP.md).

### 16. Browser (Lens WebView2)

> WebView2-based browser panel gaps.

#### What We Have

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Multi-tab browsing | ✅ | Tab bar, create/close/switch tabs, context menu |
| Navigation (back/forward/reload) | ✅ | Toolbar + keyboard shortcuts |
| URL bar | ✅ | Navigate by URL or search |
| Download manager | ✅ | `DownloadStarting` hook, progress tracking, toast on complete |
| Downloads panel | ✅ | List with status, open file/folder actions |
| Download settings | ✅ | Ask-where-to-save toggle, custom download path (folder picker) |
| Browser history | ✅ | JSON persistence, search, clear, delete entries |
| History panel | ✅ | Searchable, click to navigate |
| Hamburger menu | ✅ | Injected into child WebView2 (solves airspace problem) |
| Zoom (per-tab) | ✅ | Zoom in/out/reset with live % display |
| Find on Page | ✅ | Ctrl+F in browser, match navigation |
| Design mode | ✅ | Click elements → annotated screenshot → AI |
| Element Inspector | ✅ | `ElementInspector.svelte` — Onlook-style rendered-element → source inspection panel |
| Console capture | ✅ | `lens-console://` URI scheme, patched console.* methods (`ConsolePanel.svelte`) |
| Device preview | ✅ | Side-by-side responsive preview with emulation |

#### Gaps vs Chrome/Edge

| Feature | Chrome/Edge | Voice Mirror | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Open local files** | file:// URLs + Office integration | ❌ | Low |
| **DevTools** | Full F12 DevTools | ❌ (console output captured via init script) | Low |
| **Print** | Full print dialog | ❌ | Very low |
| **Bookmark manager** | Full bookmarks system | ❌ | Very low |

**Assessment:** Browser panel is now feature-compete for web development workflows. Downloads, history, tabs, zoom, find, and menu are all working. The remaining gaps (DevTools, print, bookmarks) are low priority — console capture + AI debugging covers the DevTools use case.

### 17. Window Capture — Universal App Vision — SHIPPED ✓ (Windows)

> **Status:** Shipped as the **see-and-drive App Preview / sandbox subsystem** (Windows-only for v1). The AI can now both *see* and *drive* a running app.

**What shipped:** The "third unlock" is live. Voice Mirror captures any running
window via **Windows Graphics Capture (WGC)**, streams it as **MJPEG** on a stable
localhost port into the App Preview panel (`SandboxPreview.svelte`), and lets the
AI drive it through one unified `@ref` element model — **CDP** (Chrome DevTools
Protocol over a remote-debugging port) for WebView2/Tauri/Electron/Chromium apps,
and **UI Automation (UIA)** for native non-CDP Windows apps (Notepad, Calculator,
Win32/WinForms/WPF/Qt/UWP). An **event-driven window-follow** service arbitrates
between user focus and AI actions so the preview tracks the right window.

**Backend:** `commands/sandbox.rs` (10 commands), `services/sandbox.rs` (CDP),
`services/uia.rs` (UIA worker), `services/window_follow.rs`, `services/window_stream.rs`.
**MCP:** `sandbox_start`, `sandbox_attach`, `sandbox_snapshot`, `sandbox_screenshot`,
`sandbox_click`, `sandbox_type`, `sandbox_close_window` (capture group).

**Original vision (for context):** Voice Mirror unlocked voice (stable) and web
vision (browser panel); universal app vision lets the AI see/drive any running
application (games, CAD, spreadsheets) the same way it does websites.

**Why it matters:** Today, if you're modding Stardew Valley, Claude can help with the code but can't *see* the running game to verify your changes. You'd have to screenshot manually. The same applies to Excel formulas, Blender models, AutoCAD drawings, WoW addon development — anything outside the browser. Closing this loop means Voice Mirror works for *every* workflow, not just web development.

**No other IDE does this.** Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code — none of them can see arbitrary running applications.

#### Technical Approach

**Windows Graphics Capture API** (WinRT, Win10 1903+) — the modern approach, same as OBS uses for window capture:
- `GraphicsCaptureItem` for a specific window handle
- `Direct3D11CaptureFramePool` delivers GPU-side frames
- Hardware accelerated, works with DirectX/OpenGL games
- Available via the `windows` crate (WinRT bindings already in our deps)

**Streaming to browser panel** via MJPEG on localhost:
```
Target Window → WinRT Graphics Capture → GPU frames
    → Encode JPEG (~2ms per frame)
    → Serve on localhost as MJPEG stream
    → <img src="http://localhost:{port}/stream/{window_id}"> in WebView2
```

MJPEG is the simplest option — no JavaScript needed, every browser supports it natively via `<img>` tag. Alternative: WebSocket + canvas for more control.

**For AI consumption:** periodic snapshot (every 1-5s) → base64 → send as vision input. The AI doesn't need 60fps. We already have `list_windows` and `capture_window` — this extends them to continuous capture.

#### Architecture

```
Rust:
  - New service: window_capture.rs
  - WinRT Graphics Capture for target window
  - Configurable FPS (5-30)
  - MJPEG endpoint: localhost:{port}/stream/{window_id}
  - Snapshot endpoint: localhost:{port}/snapshot/{window_id}

Frontend:
  - Window picker (reuse existing list_windows)
  - Display stream in browser panel or dedicated panel
  - MCP tool: "look at {window}" → snapshot → model vision input

MCP tools:
  - capture_window_start(window_title, fps) → start streaming
  - capture_window_stop() → stop streaming
  - capture_window_snapshot(window_title) → single frame for AI
```

#### Use Cases

- **Game modding:** See the running game while editing mod code
- **Spreadsheets:** AI reads Excel/Sheets and suggests formulas
- **CAD/3D:** AI reviews geometry while you model
- **Any desktop app:** Troubleshoot, automate, or get AI help with any software

#### Priority

**Medium-High** — unique differentiator, no competitor has this. Should come after LSP Tier 2 features are stable. The capture API is well-documented and the `windows` crate already has bindings. Estimated effort: Medium (new service + MJPEG server + window picker UI + MCP tools).
