# UX Completeness Audit — Voice Mirror Lens vs VS Code / Zed

> Internal doc. Comprehensive audit of interactive surfaces, context menus, keyboard shortcuts, status indicators, tab behaviors, editor micro-interactions, and drag-and-drop. Compared against VS Code and Zed.
>
> Last updated: 2026-03-04 · spot-verified 2026-06-29
>
> **Note (2026-06-29):** This is a point-in-time UX snapshot. Several "Missing"
> entries in the per-surface sections below were closed in Waves 1–3 and later
> work — the wave tables at the top of each section are the canonical "done"
> list. In particular the **persistent bottom status bar (§2.1) has since
> shipped** (`shared/StatusBar.svelte`), the **Problems panel (§2.4) shipped**,
> and font zoom / Tab-indent / F12-go-to-def / Ctrl+W / save-prompt-on-close are
> all done. Treat the wave tables + `IDE-GAPS.md` as authoritative over the older
> "Missing" tables. The remaining genuinely-open items are the P2/P3 lists at the
> bottom.

| Close to the Left | Medium |
| Split Up, Split Left | Low |

---

### 1.3 Editor Gutter Context Menu

Same as editor body (the fallback handler catches gutter clicks). Diagnostic items correctly appear when right-clicking diagnostic markers.

#### Missing vs VS Code

| Item | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Go to Line... (Ctrl+G) | Medium |
| Toggle Comment (prominent positioning) | Medium |
| Breakpoint actions | Low (requires DAP) |

---

### 1.4 File Tree Context Menu

**File:** `src/components/lens/FileContextMenu.svelte`

Four modes: **empty space**, **file**, **folder**, **git change**.

#### What We Have
- **Empty:** New File, New Folder
- **File:** Open, Open Diff (if git), New File, New Folder, Rename (F2), Delete, Copy Path, Copy Relative Path, Reveal
- **Folder:** New File, New Folder, Rename (F2), Delete, Copy Path, Copy Relative Path, Reveal

#### What We Have
Copy (Ctrl+C), Paste (Ctrl+V), Select All, Clear Terminal, Find (Ctrl+F), Split Right (Ctrl+Shift+5), Split Down (Ctrl+Shift+-)

#### What VS Code Has
Copy, Paste, Select All, Clear Terminal, Split Terminal, Find (Ctrl+F), Change Terminal Profile

#### Status

**File:** `src/components/terminal/TerminalContextMenu.svelte`

#### What We Have
Split Right, Split Down, Change Color, Change Icon, Rename (F2), Kill Terminal, Unsplit Terminal

| Toggle Find (Ctrl+F) | Medium |

---

### 1.7 Terminal Tab Strip Context Menu

**File:** `src/components/terminal/TerminalTabStrip.svelte`

#### What We Have
**Not wired.** The component accepts an `oncontextmenu` prop but `TerminalPanel.svelte` doesn't connect it.

#### Recommendation
**Medium** — Wire the existing prop to show `TerminalContextMenu`.

---

**File:** `src/components/lens/DiffViewer.svelte`

#### What We Have
Copy, Select All, Open File, Copy Path, Copy Relative Path, Reveal in File Explorer

#### Missing vs VS Code

---

### 1.9 Browser Tab Context Menu

**File:** `src/components/lens/BrowserTabBar.svelte`

#### What We Have
Close Tab (single item)

#### Missing

| Item | Priority |
|------|----------|
| **Reload Tab** | High |
| **New Tab** | High |
| Close Other Tabs | Medium |
| Duplicate Tab | Medium |

---

### 1.10 Other Surfaces

| Surface | Current Menu | Gap |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Voice Agent tab (outer strip) | Clear, Provider selection, Stop | Good — no gaps |
| Output tab (outer strip) | Clear Output, Copy All, Word Wrap, Scroll Lock | Good — no gaps |
| Terminal tab (outer strip) | None | Low — could add "New Terminal" |
| Chat/Session entries | Rename, Delete | Could add Duplicate, Export |
| Project strip avatars | Remove Project | **Edit Project dialog** (name, icon upload, color, startup script) + Open in Terminal, Copy Path — see §1.11 |
| Empty terminal sidebar | New Terminal | Could add "New with Profile..." |

---

### 1.11 Project Strip Context Menu + Edit Project Dialog

**File:** `src/components/sidebar/ProjectStrip.svelte`

**Reference:** OpenCode Desktop (`packages/app/src/components/dialog-edit-project.tsx`)

#### What We Have
Right-click on a project avatar shows a single "Remove Project" item. Project avatars display a colored letter derived from the folder name.

#### What OpenCode Desktop Has
Right-click context menu: **Edit**, Enable/Disable Workspaces, Clear Notifications, Close.

The **Edit** item opens a modal dialog with:
- **Project name** — text input (defaults to folder name)
- **Project icon** — click-to-upload image with drag-and-drop, stored as base64 data URL. When no custom image, falls back to colored avatar.
- **Color palette** — 6 color dots (pink, mint, orange, purple, cyan, lime) for avatar background. Uses CSS variables per theme. Hidden when custom image is uploaded.
- **Workspace startup script** — multiline monospace textarea for shell commands to run when opening the project (e.g. `npm run dev`, starting services)

#### Recommendation

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Edit Project dialog** (name, icon, color, startup script) | Medium | High-polish feature. Name + color are quick wins; icon upload + startup script are medium effort. |
| **Context menu expansion** (Edit, Clear Notifications, Close) | Medium | Currently only "Remove Project" — should match OpenCode's menu |
| **Startup script execution** | Medium-Large | Requires Tauri command to run shell commands on project open. Useful for auto-starting dev servers. |

---

## 2. Status Bar & Indicators

### 2.1 Bottom Status Bar — ✅ SHIPPED

#### What We Have
**A persistent bottom status bar now exists** — `src/components/shared/StatusBar.svelte`,
backed by `status-bar.svelte.js`. It surfaces git branch, ahead/behind, aggregate
diagnostics counts, cursor line:column, language mode, indentation, encoding/EOL,
LSP health, and dev-server status — most of which click through to the relevant
panel. (`StatusDropdown.svelte` remains as the multi-tab system health popover;
`StatsBar.svelte` is still the optional floating CPU/MEM debug widget.)

The gap table below is retained for historical context — the P0/P1 indicators it
lists are now present in the status bar.

#### What VS Code Has (always visible at bottom)
Branch name, sync status, error/warning counts, line:column, spaces/tabs, encoding, EOL, language mode, Copilot status, notification bell

#### What Zed Has
Branch name, diagnostics count, cursor position, indentation, line endings, language server status

#### Gap Assessment

| Indicator | Priority | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Line:Column cursor position** | P0 | Used constantly by every developer |
| **Aggregate error/warning count** | P0 | Critical for project health awareness |
| **Language mode** | P1 | Expected in any code editor |
| **Git branch name** | P1 | Already computed in GitCommitPanel; needs persistent slot |
| **Indentation type/size** | P1 | Important for formatting |
| **Ahead/behind count** | P2 | Already computed; needs persistent display |
| **LSP status** | P2 | Currently 3 clicks deep in StatusDropdown |
| Encoding (UTF-8) | P3 | Rarely needed but expected |
| EOL type (LF/CRLF) | P3 | Rarely needed but expected |

**Recommendation:** The single most impactful change is implementing a persistent bottom status bar. Most of the data already exists in stores — it just needs to be surfaced.

---

### 2.2 File/Editor Breadcrumbs

#### What We Have
**Nothing.** The only file identification is the tab title.

#### What VS Code Has
`src > lib > stores > config.svelte.js > createConfigStore > loadConfig` — each segment clickable.

#### Recommendation
**Medium priority.** Tabs show only filenames — ambiguous with duplicates across directories.

---

### 2.3 Activity Bar / Sidebar Badges

#### What We Have
ProjectStrip shows colored avatars with active indicator pills. **No badge counts.**

#### What VS Code Has
Source Control icon badge (change count), error badge, search result count badge.

#### Recommendation
**Medium priority.** Git change count badge on sidebar would provide at-a-glance awareness.

---

### 2.4 Diagnostics Panel

#### What We Have
✅ **Implemented.** `ProblemsPanel.svelte` — VS Code-style tree view grouped by file with collapse/expand, severity filter toggles (error/warning/info), text search, click-to-navigate (opens file + sets cursor to line:col). 4th bottom panel tab with badge showing total count. Status bar diagnostics button opens panel. Ctrl+Shift+M keyboard shortcut.

#### What VS Code Has
Problems panel (Ctrl+Shift+M) with filterable, sortable list of all errors/warnings across workspace.

#### Recommendation
~~**Medium priority.** Unified error browsing would be valuable.~~ **Done.**

---

## 3. Tab Behaviors

### 3.1 Editor Tabs (GroupTabBar.svelte)

#### What We Have
- Click to activate, close button (X), preview mode (single-click italic → double-click to pin)
- Dirty indicator (accent dot), read-only indicator (lock icon), diff stats badges
- Context menu (11 items), drag to reorder/move between groups
- Drop zone for file-tree drags, scroll overflow (horizontal scroll)
- Double-click empty space creates new untitled file
- Split editor button (left-click = split right, right-click = menu)
- More actions menu: Show Opened Editors, Close All, Close Saved, Enable Preview, Lock Group
- Inline tab rename (F2), file type icons

#### Missing — Critical

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Ctrl+W to close tab** | P0 | Context menu shows "Ctrl+W" hint but no handler exists — purely decorative |
| **Save prompt on dirty close** | P0 | Closing unsaved file silently loses changes — data loss risk |
| **Middle-click to close** | P1 | Works on terminal tabs but NOT on editor tabs — no `onauxclick` handler |

#### Missing — Important

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| ~~Closed tab history + Ctrl+Shift+T~~ | ~~P1~~ | ✅ Done (Wave 2) — closedTabs stack (max 20), reopenClosedTab, context menu item |
| ~~Mouse wheel scroll on tab bar~~ | ~~P1~~ | ✅ Done (Wave 2) — onwheel handler converts deltaY to scrollLeft |
| **Ctrl+Tab MRU cycling** | P2 | No tab activation history tracked |
| ~~Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown~~ | ~~P2~~ | ✅ Done (Wave 2) — prev/next editor tab with wrap-around |
| **Close to the Left** | P2 | Has "Close to the Right" but not Left |
| **Git/diagnostic tab decorations** | P2 | VS Code colors tab titles by git status |
| Tab overflow dropdown | P3 | No ">>" icon for hidden tabs |

---

### 3.2 Terminal Tabs (TerminalTabStrip.svelte)

#### What We Have
Click to activate, close button (hover), middle-click close, right-click context menu, split badge showing instance count, active tab highlight, scroll overflow

#### Missing

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| ~~Drag to reorder~~ | ~~P1~~ | Removed — acceptable as-is |
| ~~Inline rename (double-click)~~ | ~~P1~~ | Removed — prompt() dialog acceptable |
| Close Others / Close to Right | P2 | Not in context menu |
| Auto-detect terminal title | P3 | Static "Terminal N" unless manually renamed |

---

| Shortcut | Issue | Severity |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Ctrl+W** | Shown as "Close" hint in TabContextMenu but **no handler exists** | CRITICAL |
| **Ctrl+Shift+M** | **Conflicts**: bound to both `toggle-mute` AND `stats-dashboard` globally — one silently fails | HIGH |
| **Ctrl+Shift+O** | **Conflicts**: in-app `go-to-symbol` overrides global `toggle-overlay` when app is focused | HIGH |
| **Ctrl+K W / Ctrl+K U** | Shown in GroupTabBar More menu but **chord handler doesn't recognize non-Ctrl second keys** | MEDIUM |
| **Delete** | Listed as `kill-terminal` in shortcuts but **no handler registered** | MEDIUM |
| **F12** | Listed in commands.svelte.js metadata for Go to Definition but **not wired to editor keymap** | HIGH |

### 5.2 Missing Global Shortcuts

| Shortcut | VS Code Action | Priority |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Ctrl+B** | Toggle sidebar | HIGH |

## 6. Drag Interactions

### 6.1 What Works

| Surface | Drag Source | Drop Targets | Visual Feedback |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Editor tabs** (GroupTabBar) | Tab with `draggable` | Same/other tab bar (reorder/move) + file-tree drop support | Thin accent vertical line |
| **File tree** (FileTreeNode) | Files only (not folders) | EditorPane (5-zone overlay), GroupTabBar, LensWorkspace seams | Custom drag ghost, dashed zone overlay |
| **Terminal sidebar** (TerminalSidebar) | Instance rows | Same/other instance rows (reorder, cross-group move) | Top/bottom accent line, opacity fade |
| **Panel resize** (SplitPanel) | Handle divider | Continuous resize via pointer events | col-resize / row-resize cursor |
| **Window resize** (ResizeEdges) | Edge/corner strips | Native Tauri resize | Resize cursors |

### 6.2 ~~Missing~~ Done — High Priority

| Gap | Description | Status |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| ~~Tab drag → split zones~~ | ~~Dragging editor tabs does NOT activate DropZoneOverlay.~~ Custom MIME type, DropZoneOverlay detects tab drags, 5-zone split on drop. | ✅ Done (Wave 2) |

### 6.3 Missing — Medium Priority

| Gap | Description | Effort |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| ~~Text drag in editor~~ | ~~Global `dragstart` handler blocks CodeMirror text drag.~~ | Removed (acceptable as-is) |
| **External file drop from OS** | `dragDropEnabled: false` in tauri.conf.json. Enabling + adding handler would allow opening files dragged from Windows Explorer. | Medium |
| **File drag to terminal** | Cannot drop a file onto the terminal to insert its path. VS Code supports this. | Medium |

### 6.4 Missing — Low Priority

| Gap | Description |
|-----|-------------|

## Notes

- **VS Code reference repo:** `E:\Projects\references\VSCode\`
- **Zed reference repo:** Not cloned locally; comparisons based on published documentation and known features.
- **Wave 2 closed 6 items** covering tab management (closed tab history, wheel scroll, tab cycling), editor navigation (back/forward, Ctrl+hover underline), and drag-and-drop (tab drag to split zones).
- **Context menu gaps are mostly small scope.** Adding items to existing menus is straightforward once the pattern exists.
- **Wave 3 consolidated context menu infrastructure.** All 10 context menu components now share `src/styles/context-menu.css` via `@import`, with CSS custom properties driven by presets. New "Context Menus" section in Appearance settings with 4 presets (Default, Rounded, Compact, Flat), live preview, and customizable overrides.
