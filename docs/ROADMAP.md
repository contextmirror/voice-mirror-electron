# Voice Mirror — Roadmap

Voice Mirror is a **voice-native IDE**: you build real desktop apps and websites by voice, watch them render live in the in-app App Preview, and the in-app AI can see and drive the running app — the **voice → build → see → fix loop**. It starts as a Windows-first desktop app, then grows into a cross-platform server and mobile app.

## Where We Are Now (v0.1.0, mid-2026 — Windows-first launch prep)

Voice Mirror is a fully functional AI-native IDE built on **Tauri 2 + Rust + Svelte 5**, now in **Windows-first public-launch prep**:

- **231 Rust commands** across ~20 backend command modules (+ `files/` & `lens/` submodule trees)
- **102 Svelte components**, 31 reactive stores, 130+ API wrappers
- **45 MCP tools** in 5 groups (core/voice, memory, browser, capture+sandbox, n8n)
- **6700+ JS tests**, cargo check clean
- **Voice pipeline**: Whisper STT (CUDA GPU, large-v3), Kokoro + Edge TTS, energy VAD; PTT / Toggle / Dictation modes
- **Lens workspace**: CodeMirror 6 editor, file tree, terminal (xterm.js+WebGL for both the AI terminal and user shells), browser preview (native WebView2), split editor, command palette + **title-bar menu bar** sharing one **command registry** (`commands.svelte.js`, 70 commands), **LSP 37/37 feature matrix**
- **App Preview / see-and-drive (Windows)**: live preview + driving of a running app via **CDP** (web/Tauri/Electron) and **UI Automation** (native non-CDP), WGC capture + MJPEG streaming + event-driven window-follow, `sandbox_*` MCP tools
- **First-run**: onboarding wizard + Get-Started tutorial (Help → Get Started)
- **Design mode + Element Inspector**: element capture with hidden context, parent chain, pseudo-class CSS extraction
- **MCP binary**: Separate Rust binary (`voice-mirror-mcp`), stdio JSON-RPC, named pipe IPC
- **Output panel** (VS Code-style channels) + runtime **diagnostics / health-contracts** self-check

> **Launch status:** Windows-first by decision (2026-06-29). The see-and-drive
> loop, native-app driving, and push-to-talk/dictation are Windows-only for v1;
> mac/Linux get a basic build. Remaining blockers (CUDA-forced release build, MCP
> binary bundling, code signing, updater) are tracked in the internal
> launch-readiness notes (`docs/internal/`, local only — not in the public repo).

See `docs/source-of-truth/IDE-GAPS.md` for detailed feature comparison vs VS Code / Zed / Cursor.

## Near-Term: IDE Completeness

Features that close the remaining gaps between Lens and a "real IDE."

### Run / Build System
One-click Run button in the toolbar. Auto-detects project type (`package.json` → npm, `Cargo.toml` → cargo, `pyproject.toml` → python, etc.) and runs the appropriate command in the terminal. Triggered by button click OR voice ("run it"). Output goes to the existing xterm.js terminal.

### Layout Refactor (VS Code-Style Terminal)
Move the terminal from a full-width bottom panel into the center column, stacked below the editor/preview:

```
| Chat |   Editor/Preview   | File Tree |
|      |--------------------|           |
|      |     Terminal        |           |
```

This aligns with VS Code's layout and frees the bottom area for new panels.

### Spreadsheet Support
Open `.xlsx` / `.csv` files from the file tree in a web-based spreadsheet viewer (SheetJS + Handsontable or Luckysheet) rendered in the browser preview. Claude Code reads the raw data via MCP tools AND sees the spreadsheet visually via screenshot capture. Users speak edits: "Make column B bold", "Sum up Q4 revenue."

### Pixel Agents (Visual AI Agent Monitor)
Integrate [pixel-agents](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents) (MIT) — pixel art characters representing active AI agents in a virtual office canvas. Characters animate based on real agent activity (reading files, writing code, running commands). Reads Claude Code's JSONL transcripts for activity state. Lives in the bottom panel alongside the terminal.

### Remaining IDE Gaps
From `IDE-GAPS.md`:

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Workspace symbols (cross-project search) | Backend + API done; needs UI panel | Medium |
| Inlay hints (inline type annotations) | ✅ Done | — |
| Persist split editor layout | Workspace-state store + `workspace_state` commands exist (verify split-tree coverage) | Medium |
| Terminal search (Ctrl+F in scrollback) | ✅ Done | — |
| Breadcrumbs | Not started | Low |
| Clickable links/file paths in terminal | ✅ Done (Ctrl+click overlay) | — |
| Hunk-level git staging | Not started | High |
| Debug adapter (DAP) | Not started | Low — AI handles this |

### Select Element v3
Ideas from real-world testing:

- **Accessibility attributes** — capture `aria-*`, `role`, `tabindex`, `alt`, `lang`
- **Responsive breakpoints** — scan `@media` rules matching the selected element
- **Adopted stylesheets** — check `document.adoptedStyleSheets` for CSS-in-JS (closes the Stripe gap)
- **Transition/animation capture** — add `transition`, `animation`, `transform`, `will-change` to computed styles
- **Hover state diff** — programmatically trigger hover, compare computed styles before/after

## Medium-Term: Voice & Automation Platform

### Custom Wake Word — "Mirror"
Replace provider-specific wake words with a custom **"Mirror"** keyword. Train a small ONNX model (~500KB) using OpenWakeWord's training pipeline with synthetic + real samples. Provider-agnostic identity.

### Embedded n8n Dashboard
Bring n8n's workflow automation directly into Voice Mirror. Users build workflows by voice ("Create a workflow that monitors my email for invoices"), trigger them by voice ("Send the weekly report"), and set reminders ("Wake me up at 8am with traffic"). n8n dashboard embedded in the browser preview. Webhook listener in the Rust backend receives callbacks and triggers TTS.

See the detailed plan in the previous ROADMAP version for n8n implementation phases (detection, auto-start, auto-navigate, setup wizard, starter templates).

---

## Long-Term: Cross-Platform

### Phase 2: Voice Mirror Server
Run Voice Mirror as a standalone HTTP server. Access the full dashboard from `localhost:3333` in any browser. The Rust backend compiles as either a Tauri desktop app or a headless `axum` server — same logic, different transport (`invoke()` vs WebSocket/REST).

### Phase 3: Remote Access
- **LAN**: Bind to `0.0.0.0`, access from phone/tablet on the same network
- **Internet**: Cloudflare Tunnel / Tailscale integration, auth tokens
- **Multi-client**: Real-time state sync via WebSocket broadcast

### Phase 4: Mobile App
Thin client connecting to the Voice Mirror server. PWA first (responsive chat UI, push notifications, MediaRecorder for voice input), native Tauri Mobile later if needed. n8n reminders deliver via push notifications.

### Phase 5: Cloud Deployment
`docker run -p 3333:3333 voice-mirror` — hosted service with GPU for STT/TTS, user accounts, BYOK (bring your own API keys). Depends on demand.

## Execution Priority

```
Now         IDE completeness (run button, layout refactor, spreadsheet, pixel agents)
Near        Select Element v3, remaining IDE gaps from IDE-GAPS.md
Medium      Custom wake word, n8n dashboard
Later       Server mode, remote access, mobile app
Future      Cloud deployment
```

IDE completeness is the current focus — making Lens comfortable enough that users don't need to leave Voice Mirror for any coding task. The voice + AI features are already the differentiator; the IDE features are table stakes.

---

## Non-Goals

- **VS Code extension marketplace** — MCP servers are Voice Mirror's extension model
- **Node.js runtime** — pure Rust backend, no Node.js at runtime
- **Run voice processing on mobile** — phone is a thin client, STT/TTS stays on server
- **Support Electron codebase** — fully retired, Tauri 2 is the only codebase
