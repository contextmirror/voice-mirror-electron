> **Alpha — Windows-first launch.** Voice Mirror is in active development. The full voice → build → see → fix loop (live App Preview, native-app driving, push-to-talk) is **Windows-only** for v1. The macOS/Linux builds run the chat, terminal, and editor, but not yet the live-preview loop. Bug reports and feedback welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/contextmirror/voice-mirror/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JBpsSFB7EQ).

## What is Voice Mirror?

Voice Mirror is a **voice-native IDE**. You describe what you want to build out loud, an AI coding agent writes the code, and you **watch the app render live** in an in-app App Preview — the same surface the AI itself can see and drive. The north star is the **voice → build → see → fix loop**: speak, build, watch it render, point at what's wrong, fix it.

It is one desktop app that combines:

- a **Lens workspace** — CodeMirror editor with LSP, file tree, integrated terminal, and dev-server management;
- a **live App Preview** — your running web app, Tauri/Electron app, or native window mirrored inside Voice Mirror;
- an **AI that can see and drive the preview** — CDP for web/Tauri/Electron, UI Automation for native apps, the same view you're watching;
- a **Rust-native voice pipeline** — speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and voice activity detection running directly in the app.

---

## Features

### Lens workspace
A full IDE surface inside Voice Mirror: **CodeMirror 6** editor with multi-language syntax highlighting, **LSP** (diagnostics, outline, references, rename, code actions), a file tree with inline diagnostics, **split editors**, a **Command Palette**, an integrated **terminal**, **Git** changes view, and **dev-server management** that detects framework + port and captures build/console logs.

### Live App Preview *(Windows v1)*
Build an app and watch it render live, mirrored inside Voice Mirror. The preview tracks whatever you **or** the AI most recently touched, follows window focus, and cleans up when the app closes. The in-app AI drives the **same** surface you watch — click, type, navigate, screenshot — via CDP (web / Tauri / Electron) or UI Automation (native Windows apps).

### Voice interaction *(push-to-talk Windows v1)*

| Mode | Use case |
|------|----------|
| **Push to talk** | Hold to speak, release to send |
| **Dictation** | Voice-to-text into the focused input |
| **Toggle / continuous** | Hands-free conversational loop |

The voice pipeline is fully **Rust-native** — Whisper for speech-to-text (with optional **CUDA** GPU acceleration), Kokoro and Edge TTS for synthesis, and VAD for turn detection. No child processes or external binaries.

### Screen + app awareness
The AI can capture your screen or the previewed app window and reason about what it sees — analyze an error, inspect rendered UI, or verify a change actually worked.

### Built-in MCP server
`voice-mirror-mcp` is a compiled **Rust binary** (stdio JSON-RPC) that exposes Voice Mirror's capabilities — voice I/O, screen/app capture, app driving (the sandbox preview), persistent memory, browser automation, and n8n workflow control — to the AI agent. Tool groups load on demand.

### Get Started tutorial
A guided **Get Started** walkthrough (Help → Get Started), a wired title-bar menu, and the Command Palette help new users find their way around on first run.

## AI Providers

Pick a brain by **right-clicking the Voice Agent tab**. Voice Mirror supports:

| Provider | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | CLI agent | Anthropic's CLI — MCP tools, vision, full terminal, `CLAUDE.md` ecosystem |
| **OpenCode** | CLI agent | Universal gateway to many models (GPT, Gemini, Kimi, and more) with MCP support |
| **Codex / Gemini CLI / Kimi CLI** | CLI agent | Additional first-party CLI agents |
| **Ollama / LM Studio / Jan** | Local LLM | Auto-detected local servers; run models on your own hardware (vision supported) |
| **OpenAI / Groq** | Cloud API | Hosted models via API key |
| **Dictation** | Voice-to-text | No LLM — straight speech-to-text into the focused input |

CLI agents run as real PTY-backed processes inside the app with full MCP tool access. Local servers are auto-detected.

## Quick Start

### Download

Grab the latest installer from [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/contextmirror/voice-mirror/releases). Voice Mirror is **Windows-first** for v1 — the full live-preview loop targets Windows 10/11.

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Windows 10/11** | Primary — full voice → build → see → fix loop |
| **macOS / Linux** | Experimental — chat, terminal, and editor run; live App Preview / native driving / push-to-talk not yet available |

Everything is bundled — no Node.js, Rust, or build tools required to run the installer.

### Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contextmirror/voice-mirror.git
cd voice-mirror

npm install        # JS dependencies (frontend + test tooling)
npm run dev        # builds the voice-mirror-mcp binary, then launches `tauri dev`
```

`npm run dev` first compiles the native `voice-mirror-mcp` binary, then starts the Tauri app with Vite HMR. The frontend dev server runs on **port 31420** (moved off the default Tauri port so previewed apps never collide).

**Dev requirements:** Node.js 22+, the Rust toolchain (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)), the Tauri 2 prerequisites for your OS, plus LLVM/libclang and CMake (for the native ML stack). Optional: **CUDA** for GPU-accelerated Whisper.

### Build a release

```bash
npm run build      # builds the release voice-mirror-mcp binary, then `tauri build`
```

### Verify

```bash
npx vite build                                # frontend compiles
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml   # Rust backend compiles
cargo build --bin voice-mirror-mcp --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml  # MCP binary
npm test                                      # JS tests (node:test, source-inspection)
```

> Note: `cargo test --lib` currently fails on Windows due to a WebView2 DLL load — use `cargo check --tests` to verify compilation. The MCP binary tests (`cargo test --bin voice-mirror-mcp`) do run.

### Optional dependencies

- **Claude Code CLI** or **OpenCode** (for those providers) — or any of the other CLI agents
- **Ollama / LM Studio / Jan** running locally (auto-detected)
- **CUDA** toolkit for GPU-accelerated speech-to-text

## Configuration

Data and config live under a single per-user directory:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\voice-mirror\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/voice-mirror/` |
| Linux | `~/.config/voice-mirror/` |

Models, memory, logs, and `config.json` all live there. Settings are editable from the in-app Settings page — AI provider, voice engine, activation mode, audio devices, appearance, and more.

Crashes and hangs self-report to `%APPDATA%\voice-mirror\logs\crashes.log`, and a runtime self-diagnostic system surfaces broken subsystems in-app.

## Security & Trust

- **Tauri security model** — no Node.js in the WebView; all backend logic is Rust behind type-checked `#[tauri::command]` handlers and Tauri 2's capability permissions.
- **Tool-mediated actions** — every browser/app action flows `LLM → tool schema → controller`. Actions are enumerable, reviewable, and loggable.
- **Explicit capture** — screenshots are triggered by tool calls or user request, not captured passively.
- **MCP tool gating** — tool groups load on demand; the AI can only use what's loaded for the session.
