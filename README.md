```
Claude Code / OpenCode = Terminal + MCP Tools
Voice Mirror            = Eyes + Ears + Voice
Combined                = Full AI agent for your entire computer
```

## Why Voice Mirror?

| Existing Product | What's Missing |
|------------------|----------------|
| Siri / Cortana / Alexa | No real capabilities, can't "see" your screen |
| GitHub Copilot | Code only, no voice, IDE-locked |
| Claude Desktop | Not an overlay, no wake word, limited platform |
| ChatGPT Desktop | Just a chat window |

Voice Mirror is an always-on overlay that listens, sees your screen, executes commands, and speaks back — across any AI provider.

---

## What Makes This Different

- **Claude Code / OpenCode as PTY-backed brains** — runs Claude Code or OpenCode inside Electron as a real terminal. Full MCP tool access with 75+ models via OpenCode, zero extra API cost beyond the CLI itself.
- **MCP as the agent backbone** — 58 tools across 10 dynamically-loaded groups (including 3 facade tools for voice-mode efficiency). Not a plugin system — a structured tool protocol with schema validation, gating, and hot-loading.
- **Real browser automation** — not "search and summarize." Actual CDP-level click, type, navigate, screenshot, and DOM snapshot. Verified by a 102-test benchmark.
- **Wayland-native overlay** — Rust layer-shell binary for proper always-on-top on Linux/Wayland, where Electron can't do it alone.
- **Unified agent loop** — wake word + screen capture + terminal execution + browser control + persistent memory, all wired together. Most tools pick one; this closes the full Hear → See → Think → Act → Speak → Persist loop.

## Features

### Voice Interaction

| Mode | Trigger | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Wake Word** | "Hey Claude" | Hands-free, on-demand |
| **Push to Talk** | Mouse button / keyboard | Manual control |
| **Dictation** | Configurable hotkey | Voice-to-text input anywhere |

### Screen Awareness
Capture your screen at any time — the AI sees what you see and can analyze errors, UI, or anything on screen. Multi-monitor support with native Windows PowerShell capture. Images are sent directly to vision-capable LLMs (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.).

### Chat Dashboard
Full chat interface with message history, Slack-style grouped messages, markdown rendering, image paste/drop, and persistent chat sessions. AI activity status bar shows real-time provider state.

### Terminal Power
Claude Code or OpenCode runs inside Voice Mirror with full MCP tool access. Execute commands, manage files, and automate workflows — all by voice. OpenCode unlocks 75+ models (GPT, Gemini, Kimi, local Ollama, and more) through a single integration.

### 58 MCP Tools (10 groups, dynamically loaded)

| Group | Tools | Capabilities |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **core** | 4 | Voice I/O, presence tracking |
| **memory** | 6 | Semantic search, 3-tier persistent memory |
| **browser** | 16 | Full CDP automation — navigate, click, type, screenshot, cookies, storage |
| **n8n** | 22 | Workflow CRUD, executions, credentials, tags |
| **voice-clone** | 3 | Clone any voice from a 3-second audio sample |
| **screen** | 1 | Desktop screenshot capture |
| **diagnostic** | 1 | Pipeline message tracing |
| **meta** | 3 | Dynamic tool loading/unloading |
| **facades** | 3 | Single-tool wrappers for memory, browser, and n8n (voice-mode efficiency) |

### Speech Recognition

| Engine | Speed | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Whisper** (default) | Fast | OpenAI Whisper via whisper-rs (native Rust, GGML) |

### Voice Synthesis

| Engine | Speed | Voice Cloning | Voices |
|--------|-------|---------------|--------|
| **Kokoro** (default) | Fast, CPU | No | 10 built-in |
| **Qwen3-TTS** | GPU recommended | Yes | 9 presets + custom |

## AI Providers

5 built-in providers — 75+ models accessible through OpenCode. Local servers are auto-detected.

| Provider | Type | Key Features |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | CLI agent | Anthropic's gold-standard CLI. MCP tools, vision, full terminal, `CLAUDE.md` ecosystem |
| **OpenCode** | CLI agent | Universal gateway to 75+ models (GPT, Gemini, Kimi, Grok, Mistral, and more). Full MCP tool support. Auto-install from settings if not found |
| **Ollama** | Local | Auto-detect, vision (llava), run models on your own hardware |
| **LM Studio** | Local | Auto-detect, GUI-based local LLM runner |
| **Jan** | Local | Auto-detect, open source local AI |

**Why only 5?** OpenCode supports 75+ cloud providers (OpenAI, Google, xAI, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Moonshot, and more) with full MCP tool calling — no need for individual API entries. Claude Code stays as the premium Anthropic experience. Local providers stay for offline / on-hardware inference.

## Quick Start

### Download (Recommended)

Grab the latest installer from [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/contextmirror/voice-mirror-electron/releases):

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| **Windows** | `Voice-Mirror-Setup-x.x.x.exe` (NSIS installer) |
| **macOS** | `Voice-Mirror-x.x.x.dmg` |
| **Linux** | `Voice-Mirror-x.x.x.AppImage` |

Everything is bundled — no Node.js, Rust, or build tools required. The app checks for updates automatically and notifies you when a new version is available.

### Development Setup

For contributors or running from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contextmirror/voice-mirror-electron.git
cd voice-mirror-electron
npm install

# Build voice-core (Rust backend for STT, TTS, wake word)
cd voice-core
cargo build --release
cd ..

# Launch
npm start
```

**Dev requirements:** Node.js 22+, Rust toolchain, LLVM/libclang, CMake

### Optional Dependencies

- **Claude Code CLI** (for Claude provider) or **OpenCode** (for 75+ models — auto-install available from settings)
- **ffmpeg** (for voice cloning)
- **CUDA** (optional — GPU acceleration for Qwen3-TTS)

## Configuration

Config is stored per-platform:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux | `~/.config/voice-mirror-electron/config.json` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/voice-mirror-electron/config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\voice-mirror-electron\config.json` |

Settings are accessible from the in-app Settings page — AI provider, voice, activation mode, audio devices, appearance, and more.

## Use Cases

**Developer:**
> "Hey Claude, what's this error on my screen?"
> → *captures screen, analyzes code, suggests fix*
>
> "Fix it"
> → *executes commands in terminal*

**Desktop:**
> "What app is using all my memory?"
> → *checks processes, reports findings via voice*

**Voice Cloning:**
> "Clone David Attenborough's voice from this clip"
> → *downloads audio, creates clone — all responses now in that voice*

**Automation:**
> "Create an n8n workflow that emails me when my server goes down"
> → *builds workflow via MCP tools*

## Cross-Platform

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Linux | Primary | X11/Wayland, AppImage target, native Wayland orb |
| Windows | Supported | NSIS installer, hidden-window desktop shortcut |
| macOS | Supported | DMG target |

---

## Security & Trust

**Voice Mirror runs its own isolated browser environment. It does not attach to or control your existing browser.**

- **Embedded Chromium** — browser automation operates in a controlled instance launched by the app, not your system browser. No access to your existing sessions, cookies, or logged-in accounts unless you explicitly log in inside Voice Mirror.
- **Tool-mediated actions** — every browser action flows through `LLM → tool schema → browser controller → Chromium`. Actions are enumerable, reviewable, and loggable. No arbitrary JS injection.
- **Explicit screen capture** — screenshots are triggered by tool calls or user request, not captured passively. The orb visually indicates capture state.
- **MCP tool gating** — tool groups load on demand. The LLM can only access tools that have been explicitly loaded for the session.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Provider |
|----------|----------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude Code |

Cloud provider API keys (OpenAI, Google, xAI, etc.) are configured through OpenCode directly — see [OpenCode docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/) for setup.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

536 tests across 131 suites covering config safety, API key detection, provider detection, settings, startup behavior, cross-platform paths, terminal rendering, MCP memory, browser automation, IPC validation, structured logging, path safety, and more.
