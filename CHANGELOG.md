## Patch 0.7.1 — "The Streamline" (2026-02-12)

Simplifies the AI provider picker by consolidating redundant options. OpenCode covers 75+ cloud providers with full MCP support, making individual cloud API entries unnecessary. The settings page now offers a clean three-category layout: CLI Agents (Claude Code, OpenCode), Local (Ollama, LM Studio, Jan), done. Also fixes hardcoded user name in voice prompts and replaces the placeholder OpenCode icon with the official logo.

### Improved
- **Streamlined provider picker** — Removed 11 redundant provider entries (Codex, Gemini CLI, Kimi CLI, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Kimi API) from the settings dropdown. Cloud model access now goes through OpenCode; local models stay as direct options
- **Official OpenCode icon** — Replaced the generic code brackets placeholder with OpenCode's actual logo (pixel-art terminal window from their favicon), updated the background gradient from orange to their brand dark color
- **Dynamic user name in voice prompts** — The voice assistant system prompt now reads `config.user.name` instead of a hardcoded name. Falls back to "user" if not set. Configurable in Settings > General

### Fixed
- **Hardcoded "nathan" in system prompt** — `claude-spawner.js` had the user name hardcoded in the voice assistant prompt passed to Claude Code / OpenCode
- **Hardcoded "nathan" in ConversationLogger** — `ConversationLogger.js` matched `msg.from === 'nathan'` to identify user messages; now matches any non-assistant sender

### Technical
- 12 files changed across frontend, backend, and MCP server
- Removed provider entries from: `settings-ai.html`, `settings.js`, `providers/index.js`, `ai-manager.js`, `ipc-handlers.js`, `ipc-validators.js`, `main.js`, `js/main.js`
- `CLOUD_PROVIDERS_WITH_APIKEY` and `CLOUD_PROVIDERS` arrays emptied — API key UI hidden for all remaining providers
- `VALID_PROVIDERS` reduced from 16 entries to 5 (`claude`, `opencode`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `jan`)
- `cli-spawner.js` retains fallback configs for removed CLI providers in case existing user configs reference them
- Roadmap updated: provider simplification and hardcoded name items marked done

## Patch 0.7.0 — "The Gateway" (2026-02-12)

Voice Mirror can now talk to **any AI model** — not just Claude. This release adds [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) as a PTY-based AI provider, unlocking 75+ models (Kimi K2.5 Free, Gemini, GPT-4o, Ollama local models, and more) for voice interaction through a single integration. OpenCode supports MCP natively, so the full Voice Mirror tool suite (screen capture, memory, browser automation, n8n workflows) works out of the box with every model that supports tool calling.

This is the first time Voice Mirror has spoken to a non-Claude model through the MCP voice loop.

### New Features
- **OpenCode AI provider** — Full PTY integration spawns OpenCode's TUI in the xterm.js terminal, identical to the Claude Code experience
  - Appears in Settings > AI Provider under "CLI Agents (Terminal Access)" with an MCP badge
  - Auto-configures `opencode.json` with Voice Mirror's MCP server (tool groups, enabled profiles)
  - Merges with existing OpenCode config to preserve user's other MCP servers
  - TUI renders in the embedded terminal — users see thinking, tool calls, and model output in real time
  - Voice loop: speak > transcribe > inbox > model calls `claude_listen` > responds via `claude_send` > TTS speaks response
- **75+ model support** — Any model available in OpenCode (Kimi K2.5 Free, Claude, Gemini, GPT-4o, Ollama, and more) can be used as a voice assistant with full MCP tool access
- **OpenCode provider icon** — Orange gradient icon with code brackets SVG in the settings dropdown and sidebar

### Improved
- **MCP sender matching** — Python inbox polling now correctly identifies responses from any MCP-based CLI provider (OpenCode, Kimi CLI), not just Claude. All MCP tools use the `voice-claude` sender identity; the new `_sender_matches()` method handles this for all providers
- **CLI model name display** — CLI providers (Claude Code, OpenCode, Kimi CLI) no longer show stale model names from previously selected providers. The display correctly shows "OpenCode" instead of "OpenCode (llama3.1)" when a model field was left over from Ollama
- **Model identity in voice prompt** — OpenCode's voice mode prompt instructs the model to identify by its actual model name (e.g. "I'm Kimi K2.5 Free") instead of claiming to be Claude just because the MCP tools have "claude" in their names
- **Terminal dimension passthrough** — PTY now spawns at the actual xterm.js dimensions instead of hardcoded 120x30 columns. Dimensions flow from the renderer through IPC to the PTY spawn call, reducing first-frame rendering artifacts for TUI apps like OpenCode's Bubble Tea interface
- **Provider prefix stripping** — TTS now strips "OpenCode:" and "Kimi CLI:" prefixes from responses for cleaner speech output
- **Duplicate chat message prevention** — For MCP-based CLI providers, the Python bridge no longer emits a duplicate `response` event (the InboxWatcher already handles chat messages from the MCP inbox)

### Fixed
- **Missing provider validation** — Added `kimi-cli`, `kimi`, and `opencode` to the IPC validator's `VALID_PROVIDERS` array (kimi-cli was missing since its initial addition)

### Technical
- 17 files changed (16 modified, 1 new SVG asset), ~318 lines added
- New `configureOpenCodeMCP()` in `ai-manager.js` — writes `opencode.json` with `type: "local"`, `command: [array]`, `environment: {}`, and `enabled: true` (OpenCode's config format differs from Claude's `.mcp.json`)
- New `startCLIAgent()` / `stopCLIAgent()` in `ai-manager.js` — generic PTY lifecycle for non-Claude CLI agents via `cli-spawner.js`
- `ai-manager.js` resize/interrupt/isRunning/sendInput all route to `cliSpawner` alongside Claude-specific spawner
- `MCP_CLI_PROVIDERS` frozenset in Python's `inbox.py` — shared constant for providers whose MCP tools always identify as "voice-claude"
- `_CLI_MANAGED_MODEL_PROVIDERS` frozenset in Python's `config.py` — prevents stale model names in display
- Provider registered across 8 modules: `cli-spawner.js`, `providers/index.js`, `ai-manager.js`, `ipc-handlers.js`, `ipc-validators.js`, `settings-ai.html`, `settings.js`, `settings.css`
- `opencode.json` added to `.gitignore` (auto-generated MCP config, same as `.mcp.json`)
- All 490 existing tests pass

### Prerequisites
- OpenCode must be installed separately: `npm install -g opencode-ai`
- Only models with tool-calling support will work with the MCP voice loop (same requirement as Claude Code)
- OpenCode model selection is done within OpenCode's own TUI (bottom status bar), not in Voice Mirror settings

## Patch 0.6.2 — "Bulletproof" (2026-02-11)

### Improved
- **Python 3.12+ compatibility** — Installer now works with any Python 3.9–3.13+ by eliminating the `tflite-runtime` dependency (no wheels existed for Python 3.12+, Windows, or macOS)
- **Linux audio library detection** — Installer auto-installs `libportaudio2` on Debian/Fedora/Arch if missing (fixes `sounddevice` import failure)
- **onnx-asr dependency conflict resolved** — Removed `[gpu]` extra that pulled `onnxruntime-gpu` conflicting with `onnxruntime`

### Technical
- `openwakeword` installed with `--no-deps` to skip `tflite-runtime`; its real dependencies (tqdm, scipy, scikit-learn, requests, mutagen) listed explicitly in `requirements.txt`
- New `ensure_audio_libs()` in `install.sh` for PortAudio detection and installation on Linux
- Comprehensive installer CI: 6 jobs across Linux, macOS, Windows testing both quick (--skip-setup) and full setup paths
- CI verifies Python venv creation, pip install, 6 key package imports (numpy, onnxruntime, openwakeword, psutil, sounddevice, pynput), doctor health checks, and CLI linking
- Nightly cron schedule catches upstream pip/node-gyp breakage
- Fixed flaky `perf-monitor` test timing on slow CI runners

- **Theme import/export** — Save and load themes as JSON files for community sharing

- **Color derivation engine** — 10 key colors automatically derive 20+ CSS variables (hover states, borders, shadows, glows)

### Improved
- **Orb color system** — Orb ring, inner gradient, and icon colors now derive from theme accent and orbCore colors (no more hardcoded RGB)
- **Settings reorganization** — Appearance section moved from General tab to its own dedicated tab with icon cards for quick navigation

### Technical

- IPC validators for theme colors (hex format), font strings, and theme presets
- Theme export/import via Electron file dialogs (`dialog.showSaveDialog` / `dialog.showOpenDialog`)
- Snapshot/revert system — navigating away from settings without saving restores original theme
- 38 new tests for theme engine (presets, color derivation, export/import validation)
