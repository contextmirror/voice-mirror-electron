## Patch 0.6.0 — "The Paintbrush" (2026-02-11)

### New Features
- **Full theme customization** — New Appearance tab in settings with 10 key colors, 2 font families, and orb colors all user-configurable
- **5 preset themes** — Dark, Midnight, Emerald, Rose, and Slate presets with one-click switching
- **Native color picker** — Uses the OS-native color picker (works on Windows, macOS, Linux) for every customizable color
- **Live app-wide preview** — Every color/font change updates the ENTIRE app in real-time — sidebar, chat, settings, orb, everything
- **Live orb preview** — 128×128 animated orb in settings cycles through all 5 states (idle, recording, speaking, thinking, dictating) with your custom colors
- **Theme import/export** — Save and load themes as JSON files for community sharing
- **Font customization** — Choose UI font (System Default, Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Poppins, Ubuntu) and code font (Cascadia Code, Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, Source Code Pro, Consolas)
- **Color derivation engine** — 10 key colors automatically derive 20+ CSS variables (hover states, borders, shadows, glows)

### Improved
- **Orb color system** — Orb ring, inner gradient, and icon colors now derive from theme accent and orbCore colors (no more hardcoded RGB)
- **Settings reorganization** — Appearance section moved from General tab to its own dedicated tab with icon cards for quick navigation

### Technical
- New `theme-engine.js` module (~300 lines) — color utilities, HSL operations, preset definitions, CSS variable derivation
- IPC validators for theme colors (hex format), font strings, and theme presets
- Theme export/import via Electron file dialogs (`dialog.showSaveDialog` / `dialog.showOpenDialog`)
- Snapshot/revert system — navigating away from settings without saving restores original theme
- 38 new tests for theme engine (presets, color derivation, export/import validation)

## Patch 0.5.0 — "The Dashboard" (2026-02-11)

### New Features
- **Smart chat titles** — Chat sidebar auto-names from first user message immediately (no more wall of "New Chat")
- **Right-click rename** — Right-click any chat in sidebar for context menu with Rename and Delete options
- **Inline chat rename** — Click Rename to edit the title in-place; Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- **Chat input bar** — Type messages directly to your AI provider with auto-resizing textarea
- **Sidebar chat history** — Browse, search, and restore past conversations
- **AI activity status bar** — Real-time shimmer text showing what the AI is doing (tool calls, thinking, reading files)
- **Pause Agent button** — Interrupt any AI provider mid-response (Ctrl+C for Claude Code, HTTP abort for API providers)
- **Dictation waveform in orb** — Cyan waveform bars animate inside the collapsed orb during dictation
- **Voice recording waveform** — Scrolling amplitude bars in the chat input during voice recording
- **Scroll navigation buttons** — Jump to top/bottom of chat with floating buttons
- **Clear chat confirmation** — Two-click safety on the clear button to prevent accidents

### Improved
- **Settings overhaul** — Refactored into template fragments with real provider icons and cleaner sidebar nav
- **STT pre-loaded at startup** — Parakeet model loads eagerly so first dictation/PTT works instantly (no more "no speech detected" on first try)
- **Auto-start Ollama** — Detects Ollama installation on Windows/macOS/Linux and starts the service automatically
- **Status bar parses Claude Code TUI** — Detects thinking spinners, tool calls, MCP activity, and prompt state from raw PTY output
- **Always-visible pause button** — No longer flickers with status changes
- **Windows multi-monitor screenshots** — Native PowerShell GDI+ capture bypasses Electron's desktopCapturer bug that returned the same image for all displays
- **Vision image passthrough** — Screenshots sent to local LLMs now include the actual image data (Ollama native format + OpenAI content blocks)
- **Sidebar widened** — 275px with larger window control buttons for easier clicking

### Fixed
- **Dictation events not reaching UI** — Python bridge now emits `dictation_start`/`dictation_stop` events
- **Voice loop not resuming after interrupt** — Claude Code re-enters `claude_listen` after Ctrl+C
- **Screenshot picker not clickable** — Added `-webkit-app-region: no-drag` to screen picker overlay
- **Image prompt echo** — Duplicate suppression now covers image prompt text in inbox
- **Status bar stuck on "Thinking"** — Clears when Claude returns to prompt (`❯` detection)
- **PTY ANSI parsing** — Accumulates raw data before stripping escape sequences to handle split chunks
- **CI tests** — Updated for settings template refactor
- **Close button** — Changed from hide-to-tray to quit app
- **Capture button** — Always enabled regardless of vision model detection
- **numpy version** — Constrained for kokoro-onnx compatibility
