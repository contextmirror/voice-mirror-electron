## v0.8.6 — "Dashboard" (2026-02-13)

TUI dashboard for local models — replaces the blank terminal canvas with a rich ANSI-rendered dashboard when using Ollama, LM Studio, Jan, and other OpenAI-compatible providers.

### New Feature — TUI Dashboard
- **Conversation panel** (left, 65%) — scrollable chat with user/assistant messages, timestamps, and live streaming cursor
- **Tool Calls panel** (right top) — live activity feed with spinner animation for running tools, checkmark/X for completed, tool name and duration
- **Info panel** (right bottom) — model name, generation speed (tok/s), loaded tool count, voice status (Recording/Speaking/Idle)
- **Status bar** (bottom) — context usage gauge (e.g. `CTX: 2.6K/32.8K`), TTS engine, STT engine, tool call count
- **ANSI rendering** — box-drawing characters, 256-color theme (accent blue borders, green/red/yellow status), word wrapping, all rendered via escape sequences into ghostty-web
- **Scroll support** — Arrow Up/Down scrolls chat by 1 line, Page Up/Down by 10 lines
- **Resize handling** — TUI re-renders on terminal resize
- **Generation speed** — real-time tok/s calculated from streaming token count and elapsed time

### Fixed
- **TUI output captured as AI response** — TUI ANSI rendering was emitted as `stdout`, which InboxWatcher captured as the model's response text (causing chat spam and TTS reading box-drawing characters). Added separate `tui` output type for rendering and `response` type for plain text capture
- **Tool call JSON spoken by TTS** — response text was emitted to InboxWatcher before the tool parsing check, so raw JSON like `{"tool": "browser_control", ...}` was captured as the AI response and spoken aloud. Moved response emit to after tool parsing — only non-tool responses reach chat/TTS
- **Tool parse failure on missing braces** — small local models (e.g. ministral-3) sometimes omit trailing `}` from tool call JSON. The brace matcher now auto-closes incomplete JSON before parsing
- **Voice status showing system events** — events like `claude_connected` leaked into the TUI Info panel. Now filters to actual voice states (Idle, Recording, Speaking, Thinking, Processing)

### Technical
- New `electron/providers/tui-renderer.js` (~730 lines) — pure ANSI rendering engine with state model, partial re-render optimization, spinner timer
- Output type separation: `tui` (terminal rendering, ignored by InboxWatcher), `response` (plain text, captured by InboxWatcher), `stdout` (legacy non-TUI path)
- Input echo suppressed when TUI active — TUI renders its own conversation display
- Resize forwarded to API providers (previously only CLI/PTY providers received resize events)
- Voice events forwarded from main process to TUI with human-readable labels
- 8 files changed (1 new, 7 modified), ~900 insertions
- 519 tests passing

## v0.8.5 — "Plug & Play" (2026-02-13)

Plug-and-play TTS/STT engine selection with auto-install, 7 TTS engines and 5 STT engines.

### New Feature — TTS/STT Engine Selection
- **7 TTS engines**: Kokoro (local), Qwen3-TTS (local), Piper (local), Edge TTS (free cloud), OpenAI TTS (cloud), ElevenLabs (cloud), Custom API (OpenAI-compatible)
- **5 STT engines**: Parakeet (local), Whisper (local), Faster-Whisper (local), OpenAI Whisper API (cloud), Custom API (OpenAI-compatible)
- **Auto-install pip packages** — selecting an engine that requires a missing Python package prompts the user and installs it automatically
- **Data-driven settings UI** — adapter registry drives conditional fields (API key, endpoint URL, model file picker) per engine
- **Custom local model files** — native file picker for Piper `.onnx` voice files
- **Hot-swap adapters** — switch TTS/STT engines in settings without restarting the app

### Fixed
- **TTS adapter hot-swap stale reference** — NotificationWatcher held a direct reference to the TTS adapter; switching engines in settings didn't affect background notifications. Now uses a getter callback so adapter swaps are always reflected
- **TTS adapter reload after pip install** — adapter with `model=None` (failed load) wasn't rebuilt on settings save; now detects broken adapters and retries
- **Dropdown optgroup white border** — `<optgroup>` labels in select dropdowns had no dark-theme styling, falling back to Chromium's default white background

### Technical
- Refactored TTS/STT factories to `**kwargs` pattern — adding new adapters never requires changing factory signatures
- Added adapter metadata to base classes (`adapter_category`, `pip_package`, `requires_api_key`, etc.)
- 7 new Python adapter files, `requirements-optional.txt` for optional pip packages
- New IPC handlers: `check-pip-package`, `install-pip-package`, `browse-model-file`
- 29 files changed (21 modified, 8 new), ~900 insertions

## v0.8.4 — "God-File Guillotine" (2026-02-13)

Split the 4 largest files in the codebase into focused modules and fixed two Ollama voice bugs.

### Architecture — Renderer
- **Split `main.js`** (1,308 → 574 lines): Extracted `image-handler.js` (296), `ai-status.js` (325), `voice-handler.js` (148) — each handles a distinct responsibility
- **Split `settings.js`** (1,964 → 351 lines): Extracted `settings-ai.js` (786), `settings-voice.js` (313), `settings-appearance.js` (664) — one module per settings tab

### Architecture — MCP Server
- **Split `mcp-server/index.js`** (1,100 → 515 lines): Extracted `tool-groups.js` (587) containing all 9 tool group definitions
- **Fixed 7 silent `catch` blocks** in `mcp-server/handlers/core.js` — now log errors with `[MCP Core]` tag
- **Deduplicated file-based IPC** in `mcp-server/handlers/browser.js` — extracted `fileBasedRequest()` helper

### Architecture — Python
- **Extracted `_chunk_text()`** from `kokoro.py` and `qwen.py` into shared `tts/utils.py`
- **Removed debug print** from `voice_agent.py` (`[IMPORT DEBUG] tts done`)

### Fixed
- **Ollama response lost** — `extractSpeakableResponse()` could strip all content from short responses, returning empty string which was falsy and discarded; added fallback pass that preserves lightly-cleaned content when aggressive filtering removes everything
- **Ollama double-speak** — race condition between `voice_agent._wait_and_speak()` and `NotificationWatcher`: `awaiting_response` flag cleared before TTS started, letting the watcher speak the same response; added `speaking_response` flag that stays true until TTS finishes

### Technical
- 5 files modified for bug fixes, 17 files changed total for god-file splits
- 519 tests passing (JS) + 7 Python double-speak tests passing
- Version bump: 0.8.3 → 0.8.4

## v0.8.3 — "Everything in Its Place" (2026-02-13)

Final pass on file organization and path correctness. Moved remaining root-level files into their logical directories and fixed all path regressions from the moves.

### File Moves
- **Spawners to `providers/`**: Moved `claude-spawner.js` and `cli-spawner.js` from `electron/` into `electron/providers/` — colocated with the provider system that consumes them
- **IPC validators to `ipc/`**: Moved `ipc-validators.js` from `electron/` into `electron/ipc/validators.js` — colocated with the IPC handler modules
- All consumer imports updated across 6 files (ai-manager, claude-provider, cli-provider, ipc/index, ipc/misc, test)

### Fixed
- **Claude Code not spawning** — 6 `__dirname` paths in `claude-spawner.js` still pointed one level too shallow after the move to `providers/`; MCP server, python dir, and vendor paths all resolved to `electron/` instead of the project root
- **Provider icons not loading** — 13 CSS `url()` paths in `settings.css` pointed to `../assets/` instead of `../../assets/` after the CSS moved from `electron/styles/` to `electron/renderer/styles/`

### Code Improvements
- **Deduplicated `_getConfigBase()`** in `cli-spawner.js` — replaced with `getDataDir()` from `platform-paths.js`
- **Completed barrel files**: `browser/index.js` now exports all 20+ public APIs; `window/index.js` now exports `createTrayService`
- **Added `isRunning()`** to `diagnostic-watcher.js` — matches standard service lifecycle pattern

### Documentation
- Added `README.md` to `electron/lib/`, `electron/tools/`, `electron/browser/`
- Updated `electron/README.md` structure tree for all file moves
- Fixed stale path references in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/GHOSTTY-WEB-MIGRATION.md`

### Technical
- 18 files modified, 3 new files created
- 519 tests passing, 0 failures
- Zero root-level source files remain outside their domain directories

## v0.8.2 — "World-Class Standards" (2026-02-13)

Comprehensive code quality refactor across 8 phases: architecture decomposition, logging standardisation, error consistency, shared pattern extraction, service lifecycle unification, security hardening, and new tests. Executed by a coordinated team of 10 agents.

### Architecture
- **Split `ipc-handlers.js`** (889 lines) into 6 focused modules under `electron/ipc/`: `window.js`, `config.js`, `screen.js`, `ai.js`, `misc.js`, and `index.js` — each handler group now lives in its own file
- **Extracted `main.js` utilities**: `startOllamaServer()` to `electron/lib/ollama-launcher.js`, `syncVoiceSettingsToFile()` to python-backend service method, `ensureLocalLLMRunning()` to ai-manager service method (main.js reduced by ~160 lines)
- **Created `electron/lib/` directory** with shared utilities: `json-file-watcher.js` (factory for 3 watchers), `windows-screen-capture.js` (deduplicated from 2 files), `ollama-launcher.js`, `safe-path.js`
- **Removed Serper.dev integration**: Deleted `serper-search.js` (152 lines) and all `SERPER_API_KEY` references — web search now uses webview-based Google scraping exclusively, no external API key required

### Logging
- **Structured logger**: Extended `electron/services/logger.js` with level methods — `info()`, `warn()`, `error()`, `debug()` — each accepting a `[Tag]` parameter
- **Full migration**: All 336 `console.log/error/warn` calls replaced with structured logger calls (main process) and `createLog()` wrapper (renderer) — zero raw console calls remain
- **Debug gating**: `debug()` level only emits when `VOICE_MIRROR_DEBUG=1` environment variable is set
- **Renderer logger**: New `electron/renderer/log.js` provides `createLog('[Tag]')` for renderer-side modules
- **ASCII-safe log output**: Replaced all emoji/Unicode icons with ASCII alternatives in both Electron logger and Python bridge — no more mojibake on Windows consoles

### Consistency
- **IPC response format**: All 57 IPC handlers now return `{ success: boolean, data?: any, error?: string }` — no more mixed `{ ok }`, plain values, or `null` returns
- **Browser tool responses**: Unified to `{ ok: boolean, action: string, result?: any, error?: string }` across webview-actions, browser-fetch, and browser-search
- **Service lifecycle**: All services now expose `start()`, `stop()`, `isRunning()` — renamed hotkey-manager's `init()`/`destroy()` and added `isRunning()` to all watchers

### Deduplication
- **`electron/constants.js`**: Shared `CLI_PROVIDERS` and `DEFAULT_ENDPOINTS` — removed duplicate definitions from 6 files
- **`electron/browser/search-utils.js`**: Extracted shared `formatResults()` from browser-search
- **`electron/lib/json-file-watcher.js`**: Factory replaces ~150 lines of duplicate watch-debounce-parse logic in each of the 3 watcher services
- **Platform paths**: Consolidated `getDataDir()` to single source (`platform-paths.js`) — removed duplicate implementations from config.js and claude-spawner.js
- **Trimmed over-exports**: webview-snapshot.js reduced from 8 to 2 exports, webview-actions.js from 17 to 5

### Security
- **Path traversal prevention**: New `electron/lib/safe-path.js` with `ensureWithin(base, userPath)` — applied to 4 chat IPC handlers that accepted user-supplied file IDs
- **API key audit**: Verified no API key values are logged anywhere in the codebase (keys are passed to APIs but never appear in logs)

### Tests
- **42 new tests** across 6 files: `constants.test.js`, `safe-path.test.js`, `logger-levels.test.js`, `search-utils.test.js`, `json-file-watcher.test.js`, `service-lifecycle.test.js`
- **Integration test scaffold**: New `test/integration/` directory with service lifecycle verification
- **Test count**: 477 -> 519 (0 failures, 2 skipped)

### Technical
- 65 files modified, 11 new files created, 2 deleted
- 519 tests passing, 0 failures
- Structured logger calls: 6 -> 338, raw console calls: 336 -> 0
- All log icons ASCII-safe across Electron (JS) and Python backend

## v0.8.1 — "Spring Cleaning" (2026-02-13)

Deep codebase audit and cleanup: 7 agents scanned every source file for dead code, unused exports, unreachable paths, and tightening opportunities. A second pass caught cascading dead code created by the first round of removals. Three runtime bugs were also discovered and fixed.

### Fixed
- **Missing `os` import in main.js** — `startOllamaServer()` used `os.homedir()` without importing `os`, causing a crash on macOS/Linux Ollama path discovery
- **Parentless dialogs in ipc-handlers.js** — Theme export/import and font upload dialogs called `ctx.getWindow()` (nonexistent) instead of `ctx.getMainWindow()`, resulting in dialogs with no parent window
- **Broken config access in claude-spawner.js** — `getVoiceSystemPrompt()` called `config.get()` which doesn't exist; fixed to use `loadConfig()` properly

### Removed
- **12 dead files deleted** (~1,840 lines):
  - `python/legacy/` entire folder (8 files) — old tool system with zero imports
  - `electron/browser/browser-utils.js` — Playwright-era leftover, all functions duplicated locally
  - `electron/browser/config.js` — Playwright browser-profile config, unused by webview architecture
  - `electron/tools/handlers/web-search.js` — orphaned handler with no tool definition or wiring
  - `electron/services/push-to-talk.js` — PTT fully handled by Python's GlobalHotkeyListener
  - `mcp-server/lib/memory/SessionManager.js` — never instantiated
  - `mcp-server/lib/memory/sync.js` — MemorySync file watcher, never instantiated
  - `mcp-server/lib/memory/ConversationLogger.js` — never instantiated
  - `mcp-server/lib/memory/session-sync.js` — only consumer was dead `syncSessions()` method
  - `mcp-server/lib/memory/index.js`, `search/index.js` — barrel re-exports never imported
  - Orphaned test files: `sync.test.js`, `session-sync.test.js`
- **~75 dead exports/functions removed** across all modules:
  - Electron core: `sendAIInput`, `isClaudeRunning`, `isClaudeAvailable`, `pttService` lifecycle, `updateCaptureButtonState`, unused window manager methods (`toggle`, `show`, `hide`, `isVisible`, `getPosition`, `setPosition`, `getBounds`, `setBounds`, `send`), unused tray methods (`destroy`, `getTray`, `setTooltip`), 6 dead config exports, dead font-manager test exports
  - Renderer UI: entire tool card system (`addToolCallCard`, `addToolResultCard`, `getToolIcon`, `truncateResult`, `formatToolName`), `destroyOrbCanvas`, `setOrbColors`, `hideTerminal`, `getTerminalLocation`, `clearThemeOverrides`, `PRESET_NAMES`, dead `CLOUD_PROVIDERS_WITH_APIKEY` pathway, dead state properties (`terminalVisible`, `settingsVisible`)
  - Services: `autoSelect`, `clearCache`, `getAllProviderConfigs`, `getDisplayName` from provider-detector; dead methods from inbox-watcher, perf-monitor, push-to-talk, uiohook-shared, logger, diagnostic-collector; dead exports from python-backend
  - Browser: 9 dead re-exports from index.js, `trackError`/`isActive` from browser-controller, `offEvent`/`goBack`/`goForward`/`reload` from webview-cdp, `getStoredRefs`/`cachedRefsMode` from webview-actions
  - Providers: 15 of 16 exports removed from providers/index.js (only `createProvider` kept), 6 dead base-provider methods + legacy callback system, 9 dead subclass overrides (`getType`, `isPTY`, `supportsMCP`), 7 dead openai-provider setter methods, dead claude-provider methods
  - Tools: unused `getTool` import and dead `onToolCall`/`onToolResult`/`maxIterations` fields
  - MCP: `syncSessions` from MemoryManager, `mergeSmallChunks` from Chunker, 5 dead SQLiteIndex methods, `searchVectorBatch`/`findMostSimilar` from vector search, `getRecommendedProvider` and class re-exports from embeddings, `debounce` from utils
- **Dead CSS** (~70 lines): legacy `.message` styles, `.terminal-line` styles, `#terminal-close`, `.stagger-*` animation utilities, `.provider-icon-codex`, `.provider-icon-gemini-cli`
- **Dead IPC channels**: `backend-response` (never sent), `toggle-perf-monitor` (no-op)
- **Dead dependency**: removed `chokidar` from mcp-server/package.json (only used by deleted sync.js)
- **Duplicate eslint entry**: removed duplicate `Notification: "readonly"` in eslint.config.js

### Technical
- 66 files changed, +75/-3,463 lines
- All 477 tests passing after cleanup
- Two-pass audit approach: first pass removed obvious dead code, second pass caught cascading dead code (e.g. push-to-talk.js orphaned after its import was removed)
- Platform-specific code preserved: wayland-orb.js (Linux), input group escalation (Linux), cross-platform path resolution

## v0.8.0 — "The Ghost in the Shell" (2026-02-12)

Replaces xterm.js with [ghostty-web](https://github.com/coder/ghostty-web) — Ghostty's VT parser compiled to WASM. The result: better TUI rendering for Claude Code and OpenCode, rock-solid provider switching with 4-layer output gating, and zero xterm.js dependencies. Also fixes the long-standing mouse keybind collision bug (Discord/OBS-style non-suppression), adds tool profile support for OpenCode, and bumps the MCP listen timeout to 5 minutes.

### New Features
- **ghostty-web terminal** — Full terminal emulation via Ghostty's WASM-compiled VT parser. Same API surface as xterm.js (`Terminal`, `FitAddon`) but with superior escape sequence handling and canvas rendering. Async WASM initialization, SGR mouse events for Bubble Tea TUI scroll support, and proper `customKeyEventHandler` semantics (inverted from xterm.js — `true` = "handled/stop")
- **OpenCode tool profiles** — The Tool Profiles settings section (previously Claude Code only) now appears for all MCP CLI providers. OpenCode users get the same profile picker and tool group checkboxes as Claude Code
- **AGENTS.md** — New instruction file for MCP-connected agents (OpenCode, Kimi, etc.). Documents project architecture, MCP tool groups, voice mode workflow, and security rules. Equivalent of `python/CLAUDE.md` for non-Claude providers

### Improved
- **Provider switch stability** — 4-layer output gating prevents old PTY output from bleeding into the new provider's terminal during rapid switching (Claude Code → Ollama → OpenCode → back):
  1. Spawner-level generation counters (`claude-spawner.js`, `cli-spawner.js`) — stale PTY callbacks silently dropped
  2. Main-process `outputGated` flag (`ai-manager.js`) — blocks all non-start events between stop and new provider start
  3. Renderer-side generation check — catches any events that slip through layers 1-2
  4. Aggressive `clearTerminal()` — ANSI clear sequences + explicit canvas wipe + viewport reset
- **Thread-safe TTS playback** — `_play_audio()` uses a local process reference instead of reading `self._playback_process` directly, preventing `NoneType` crashes when another thread interrupts during provider switch
- **Notification watcher provider awareness** — Reseeds `last_seen_message_id` when the AI provider changes, preventing old inbox messages from being spoken aloud on switch
- **Clean TTS handoff** — `stop_speaking()` called before replacing the TTS adapter, ensuring no orphaned ffplay processes
- **MCP listen timeout** — Default `claude_listen` timeout increased from 60s to 300s (5 minutes). Lock timeout updated to match (310s). Reduces premature voice loop disconnections during long pauses

### Fixed
- **Keyboard keys no longer blocked by mouse side button bindings** — When gaming mice firmware-map side buttons to keyboard keys (e.g. "4", "5"), those keys were suppressed system-wide by pynput. Now bound keys pass through to other apps (Discord/OBS-style). Only key-repeat events are suppressed during hold to prevent character flooding
- **Dictation stray character cleanup** — When a printable key (e.g. "5") is bound to dictation, the character that leaks through on keydown is automatically erased by a queued Backspace before the transcribed text is injected
- **pynput implicit None suppression bug** — `_win32_kb_filter` and `_win32_mouse_filter` returned implicit `None` for non-matching events, which pynput treated as "suppress" — blocking ALL keyboard/mouse input system-wide when any key was bound
- **Toggle-panel hotkey save corruption** — Settings save now reads `dataset.rawKey` first, preventing the accelerator string from being mangled by display formatting in `textContent`
- **ghostty-web visual rendering glitch** — Overrode ghostty-web's default partial render loop with full-render (`forceAll: true`) to fix characters appearing shifted during fast streaming output from TUI apps

### Removed
- **xterm.js dependency** — Removed `xterm`, `xterm-addon-fit`, and `xterm-addon-web-links` from package.json (3 packages removed, 1 added)
- **Dead xterm.js CSS** — Removed `.xterm`, `.xterm-viewport`, and related selectors (~54 lines)
- **xterm naming throughout codebase** — Renamed HTML IDs (`xterm-container` → `terminal-mount`), JS variables (`xtermContainer` → `terminalMount`), functions (`initXterm` → `initTerminal`), and updated comments/logs across 13 files

### Technical
- 26 files changed, +628/-183 lines across Electron frontend, Python backend, MCP server, and docs
- ghostty-web loaded via UMD script tag (exposes `window.GhosttyWeb`), WASM initialized before first Terminal instance
- DPI scaling monkey-patch fixes ghostty-web's `Terminal.resize()` overwriting canvas dimensions without DPI scaling
- Window-level wheel scroll handler with coordinate hit-testing: SGR mouse events for TUI apps with mouse tracking, arrow key fallback for TUIs without, viewport scrolling for normal mode
- `selection` → `selectionBackground` in theme objects (ghostty-web API difference)
- `safeFit()` no longer subtracts 1 column — ghostty-web handles subpixel metrics correctly (no more HiDPI hack)
- `clearTerminal()` pipeline: `term.reset()` → `\x1b[2J\x1b[3J\x1b[H` → canvas `fillRect` with identity transform → viewport reset
- Generation counter pattern: monotonic counter bumped on spawn/stop, callbacks capture generation at closure time, `myGen !== spawnGeneration` gates stale events
- `_win32_kb_filter` rewritten: callbacks (`_on_press`/`_on_release`) handle trigger start/stop instead of the filter. Filter only suppresses repeat keydowns
- New `_queue_dictation_backspace()` method sends Backspace via threaded pynput Controller 30ms after keydown
- `LISTENER_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` updated from 70s to 310s to match new 300s default listen timeout
- All 490 tests pass

## Patch 0.7.1 — "The Streamline" (2026-02-12)

Simplifies the AI provider picker by consolidating redundant options. OpenCode covers 75+ cloud providers with full MCP support, making individual cloud API entries unnecessary. The settings page now offers a clean three-category layout: CLI Agents (Claude Code, OpenCode), Local (Ollama, LM Studio, Jan), done. Also adds auto-install prompting for OpenCode, fixes hardcoded user name in voice prompts, and replaces the placeholder OpenCode icon with the official logo.

### New Features
- **Auto-install OpenCode prompt** — When a user selects OpenCode in the provider dropdown but it's not installed, a toast notification appears with an "Install" button. Clicking it runs `npm install -g opencode-ai` in the background with progress feedback. Works cross-platform (Windows: `npm.cmd`, Unix: `npm`). Falls back to manual install instructions on permission errors
  - New IPC handlers: `check-cli-available` (PATH detection) and `install-cli` (npm global install with allowlist)
  - 2-minute timeout for slow networks; no sudo/elevation required

### Improved
- **Streamlined provider picker** — Removed 11 redundant provider entries (Codex, Gemini CLI, Kimi CLI, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Kimi API) from the settings dropdown. Cloud model access now goes through OpenCode; local models stay as direct options
- **Official OpenCode icon** — Replaced the generic code brackets placeholder with OpenCode's actual logo (pixel-art terminal window from their favicon), updated the background gradient from orange to their brand dark color
- **Dynamic user name in voice prompts** — The voice assistant system prompt now reads `config.user.name` instead of a hardcoded name. Falls back to "user" if not set. Configurable in Settings > General

### Fixed
- **Hardcoded "nathan" in system prompt** — `claude-spawner.js` had the user name hardcoded in the voice assistant prompt passed to Claude Code / OpenCode
- **Hardcoded "nathan" in ConversationLogger** — `ConversationLogger.js` matched `msg.from === 'nathan'` to identify user messages; now matches any non-assistant sender

### Technical
- 16 files changed across frontend, backend, and MCP server
- Removed provider entries from: `settings-ai.html`, `settings.js`, `providers/index.js`, `ai-manager.js`, `ipc-handlers.js`, `ipc-validators.js`, `main.js`, `js/main.js`
- `CLOUD_PROVIDERS_WITH_APIKEY` and `CLOUD_PROVIDERS` arrays emptied — API key UI hidden for all remaining providers
- `VALID_PROVIDERS` reduced from 16 entries to 5 (`claude`, `opencode`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `jan`)
- `cli-spawner.js` retains fallback configs for removed CLI providers in case existing user configs reference them
- New IPC handlers in `ipc-handlers.js`: `check-cli-available` uses `isCLIAvailable()` from cli-spawner; `install-cli` uses allowlist pattern (`{ opencode: 'opencode-ai' }`) to prevent arbitrary npm installs
- `notifications.js` `updateToast()` now removes action buttons on state transitions (prevents stale Install button during loading)
- Roadmap updated: provider simplification, auto-install, and hardcoded name items marked done

## Patch 0.7.0 — "The Gateway" (2026-02-12)

Voice Mirror can now talk to **any AI model** — not just Claude. This release adds [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) as a PTY-based AI provider, unlocking 75+ models (Kimi K2.5 Free, Gemini, GPT-4o, Ollama local models, and more) for voice interaction through a single integration. OpenCode supports MCP natively, so the full Voice Mirror tool suite (screen capture, memory, browser automation, n8n workflows) works out of the box with every model that supports tool calling.

This is the first time Voice Mirror has spoken to a non-Claude model through the MCP voice loop.

### New Features
- **OpenCode AI provider** — Full PTY integration spawns OpenCode's TUI in the xterm.js terminal, identical to the Claude Code experience
  - Appears in Settings > AI Provider under "CLI Agents (Terminal Access)" with an MCP badge
  - Auto-configures `opencode.json` with Voice Mirror's MCP server (tool groups, enabled profiles)
  - Merges with existing OpenCode config to preserve user's other MCP servers
  - TUI renders in the embedded terminal — users see thinking, tool calls, and model output in real time
  - Voice loop: speak > transcribe > inbox > model calls `claude_listen` > responds via `claude_send` > TTS speaks response
- **75+ model support** — Any model available in OpenCode (Kimi K2.5 Free, Claude, Gemini, GPT-4o, Ollama, and more) can be used as a voice assistant with full MCP tool access
- **OpenCode provider icon** — Orange gradient icon with code brackets SVG in the settings dropdown and sidebar

### Improved
- **MCP sender matching** — Python inbox polling now correctly identifies responses from any MCP-based CLI provider (OpenCode, Kimi CLI), not just Claude. All MCP tools use the `voice-claude` sender identity; the new `_sender_matches()` method handles this for all providers
- **CLI model name display** — CLI providers (Claude Code, OpenCode, Kimi CLI) no longer show stale model names from previously selected providers. The display correctly shows "OpenCode" instead of "OpenCode (llama3.1)" when a model field was left over from Ollama
- **Model identity in voice prompt** — OpenCode's voice mode prompt instructs the model to identify by its actual model name (e.g. "I'm Kimi K2.5 Free") instead of claiming to be Claude just because the MCP tools have "claude" in their names
- **Terminal dimension passthrough** — PTY now spawns at the actual xterm.js dimensions instead of hardcoded 120x30 columns. Dimensions flow from the renderer through IPC to the PTY spawn call, reducing first-frame rendering artifacts for TUI apps like OpenCode's Bubble Tea interface
- **Provider prefix stripping** — TTS now strips "OpenCode:" and "Kimi CLI:" prefixes from responses for cleaner speech output
- **Duplicate chat message prevention** — For MCP-based CLI providers, the Python bridge no longer emits a duplicate `response` event (the InboxWatcher already handles chat messages from the MCP inbox)

### Fixed
- **Missing provider validation** — Added `kimi-cli`, `kimi`, and `opencode` to the IPC validator's `VALID_PROVIDERS` array (kimi-cli was missing since its initial addition)

### Technical
- 17 files changed (16 modified, 1 new SVG asset), ~318 lines added
- New `configureOpenCodeMCP()` in `ai-manager.js` — writes `opencode.json` with `type: "local"`, `command: [array]`, `environment: {}`, and `enabled: true` (OpenCode's config format differs from Claude's `.mcp.json`)
- New `startCLIAgent()` / `stopCLIAgent()` in `ai-manager.js` — generic PTY lifecycle for non-Claude CLI agents via `cli-spawner.js`
- `ai-manager.js` resize/interrupt/isRunning/sendInput all route to `cliSpawner` alongside Claude-specific spawner
- `MCP_CLI_PROVIDERS` frozenset in Python's `inbox.py` — shared constant for providers whose MCP tools always identify as "voice-claude"
- `_CLI_MANAGED_MODEL_PROVIDERS` frozenset in Python's `config.py` — prevents stale model names in display
- Provider registered across 8 modules: `cli-spawner.js`, `providers/index.js`, `ai-manager.js`, `ipc-handlers.js`, `ipc-validators.js`, `settings-ai.html`, `settings.js`, `settings.css`
- `opencode.json` added to `.gitignore` (auto-generated MCP config, same as `.mcp.json`)
- All 490 existing tests pass

### Prerequisites
- OpenCode must be installed separately: `npm install -g opencode-ai`
- Only models with tool-calling support will work with the MCP voice loop (same requirement as Claude Code)
- OpenCode model selection is done within OpenCode's own TUI (bottom status bar), not in Voice Mirror settings

## Patch 0.6.2 — "Bulletproof" (2026-02-11)

### Improved
- **Python 3.12+ compatibility** — Installer now works with any Python 3.9–3.13+ by eliminating the `tflite-runtime` dependency (no wheels existed for Python 3.12+, Windows, or macOS)
- **Linux audio library detection** — Installer auto-installs `libportaudio2` on Debian/Fedora/Arch if missing (fixes `sounddevice` import failure)
- **onnx-asr dependency conflict resolved** — Removed `[gpu]` extra that pulled `onnxruntime-gpu` conflicting with `onnxruntime`

### Technical
- `openwakeword` installed with `--no-deps` to skip `tflite-runtime`; its real dependencies (tqdm, scipy, scikit-learn, requests, mutagen) listed explicitly in `requirements.txt`
- New `ensure_audio_libs()` in `install.sh` for PortAudio detection and installation on Linux
- Comprehensive installer CI: 6 jobs across Linux, macOS, Windows testing both quick (--skip-setup) and full setup paths
- CI verifies Python venv creation, pip install, 6 key package imports (numpy, onnxruntime, openwakeword, psutil, sounddevice, pynput), doctor health checks, and CLI linking
- Nightly cron schedule catches upstream pip/node-gyp breakage
- Fixed flaky `perf-monitor` test timing on slow CI runners

- Theme export/import via Electron file dialogs (`dialog.showSaveDialog` / `dialog.showOpenDialog`)
- Snapshot/revert system — navigating away from settings without saving restores original theme
