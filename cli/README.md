# cli/

Setup wizard, health checker, and app launcher for Voice Mirror. Built with [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) for CLI parsing and [@clack/prompts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clack/prompts) for interactive TUI flows.

## Commands

```bash
voice-mirror setup       # Interactive onboarding wizard (default if no command given)
voice-mirror doctor      # Check system health and dependencies
voice-mirror start       # Launch Voice Mirror (optionally with --dev)
```

### `setup`

Walks users through first-time configuration: AI provider selection, Ollama installation/model pulling, voice-core binary check, and config file generation. Supports `--non-interactive` mode with flags for CI/scripted installs.

### `doctor`

Runs all system checks (Node version, voice-core binary, Ollama, Claude CLI, ffmpeg, MCP server deps) and prints a pass/fail summary. Exits with code 1 if any issues are found.

### `start`

Delegates to `npm start` in the project root. Pass `--dev` for development mode.
